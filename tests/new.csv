"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","Got this a few days ago and set it up for our daughter to get acquainted with. She's 2 years old and was able to get on and off of it without any help or problems. I do wish it locked into the open position, but that's nothing major. We haven't used it for a full night yet, so the true test of time is yet to be determined. But, so far so good!",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","so far this cot is perfect, it is for my granddaughter to use while holiday company is using her room.  it arrived quickly, and is more than a fair price for it's instant setup and sturdy base.  my 5 yr old granddaughter can set it up and fold it down to slide into it's storage case in the mornings all by herself.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",We use this regularly for naps at grandmom's and naps on the beach.  Folds up easy and top sheet comes off for washing.,5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",We have had both our two year old and four year old use this bed. They love it. This is also very lightweight and very compact for traveling. As a bonus the fabric is removable for washing. Highly recommend!,5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","my 2 1/2 year old grandson has outgrown the pack n play for naps, but isn't ready for a big bed.  this cot is the perfect solution for occasional naps at grammy's house!  unfolds in seconds like a beach chair and seems sturdy...then folds back up and gets stored in the closet till next time.  the perfect bed for occasional naps or overnights!",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","This cute cot arrived quickly, and seems very sturdy. However, it smelled to high heaven of a chemical when I opened the box. So bad that I had to put it outside until I had time to wash it. I washed the cot, the cover and sheet in hot soapy water, rinsed it and dried it in the sun. Luckily the smell went away. So don't wait until the last minute to use this cot, wash it first. It will be so much easier than dragging a twin mattress up from the basement, and warmer than a blanket on the floor.",4
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","These have worked out great for my child care nappers.  Having them up of the floor is healthier, in my opinion, and no more accident stains on the carpet is a real plus.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",Best thing if you have children and don't take much space,5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","We got this for when we're traveling in hotels and didn't want to pay excessive nightly charges for cots that are old, rusted out, and sometimes unavailable. This is exactly what we were expecting and are very happy with our purchase.This accommodated our 2.5 year old who is 36' tall and 35 lbs with plenty more room to spare.I would have given this 5 stars if there was more padding, but it was VERY easy to put a extra blanket under the liner/sheet (that's included) for extra cushion.",4
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","My grandchildren were coming to visit so I purchased THREE of these for the toddlers.They love them so much they don't want to sleep anywhere else.  This is a great productand well worth the small investment, plus they fold up into a small little bag.  It would bevery useful to take on trips or for sleep overs with cousins or family.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","Bought 2 of these to use over the holidays, we were having a houseful. My grandsons, aged 4 and both tall for their ages, slept on them for their whole visit. They fold and unfold easily and have a nice bag to store them in.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",,5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",This portable bed was perfect for my two and half year old.  It is made very sturdy and it seems like it is very comfortable for him.  Delivery was fast.,5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","Nice size, folds up nicely ,stores nicely. Washable cover pills up so buy extra cot sheets in t-shirt cotton material.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","My son would not lay down on this, much less sleep on it. He is 2.5 and quite tall for his age so this may be part of it. I don't know if ours is faulty, we have heard other people had good experiences with it but we have never been able to make it work.",2
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",This is exactly what we were looking for.  It will fit well with the sleeping bag to go on top.,5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","I bought this for our granddaughter for napping and for when we are visiting overnight elsewhere.  She likes it so far.  Very easy setup and just her size.  She is just turning two, but it should work for at least a couple of years.  I also bought a Disney Nap Mat that works well with it for nap time.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",I bought this for my grand daughter for sleeping when she came to visit. I used it about 6 times and one of the end clips is now broken. She is only 3 and weighs about  40 pounds yet this piece of junk couldn't hold up under normal use. I don't know how you can show a picture of 2 kids sitting on it and claim it is suitable for a daycare use when it fell apart so easily.,1
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","This was a great purchase,I have a 2 year old grand child.  He loved it.  It is easy to store and easy to assemble.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",Everybody liked these including the grandkids and their parents. Simple to assemble and disassemble. Fold up very compactly for easy storage. Survived a week of use by the grandkids which makes them pretty tuff. Great buy for the money.,5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",This cot is great for toddlers.  It folds up very small and it seems very comfortable.  My 2.5 year old was very excited that it was his bed during our most recent trip.  I added a couple of blankets beneath the sheet that it comes with to add some extra cushion.  I would highly recommend this to others looking for a travel bed option for kids who have outgrown a crib.,5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","Purchased for my 2 year old for weekend trips and sleepovers. He sleeps well on it. It's well constructed and I expect it will last until he outgrows it. Even if it doesn't, it's a great buy for the price!",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",I was hoping it was more comfortable than it looked but there is a bar across the middle that makes it very uncomfortable. It doesn't matter how portable it is if your child won't sleep on it and my 2 y/o won't.,1
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","My almost 4 year old grandson sleeps at my house from time to time and I thought this would be a perfect solution.  He ends up sleeping with me and hasn't slept in th cot yet, but he likes playing on it.",3
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","the children love it. they make nap time ez and fun for the children. especially with toddlers, it gives them the experience of being self efficient .",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",At this price we had one shipped to each grandparents' house!  Our 3 year old calls it her &#34;little bed&#34; and loves it.  It's very similar to the beds at day care so it doesn't seem strange to her.  Carry bag and cover sheet are great and it folds up to the size of a nylon camping chair.We also put a regular fitted crib sheet over it since the nylon is a little rough.,5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","My daughter is almost 3, and has been too big for her pack and play for over a year.  We've struggled with hotels and overnights to family's houses for some time, and finally found this cot.  It's great - the perfect height for her to get in and out of (and not too high if she were to roll out at night), and it's comfortable for her to sleep on.  I wish we would have found this earlier instead of trying to position her on adult beds surrounded by mountains of pillows to keep her from rolling out.  Great buy!  Very durable - can't beat the price!It comes with a fitted sheet, but it's not very soft.  We use the sheet in case of night-time accidents, because it looks like it would offer a little water protection, but then I also lay a fleece blanket down on top of it.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","Bought this for my granddaughter for sleep overs....works very well, folds up for easy storage and she loves sleeping on it",4
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","This is the third Regalo cot we have purchased for each of our grandchildren's 3rd birthdays. The cots are great!  Easy to set up and take down, provide ample support for sleeping, comes with a carrying bag. The grandkids use them (along with their favorite character slumber bags) for sleepovers with us and other relatives and when going on family campouts at the beach, in the desert or Big Bear. The cots don't take up a lot of space when traveling or when in storage between uses. A truly great product with a great price.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","This didn't even last a 2 weeks before one of the bars bent. My daughter said it wasn't comfy and she didn't sleep well at all. We gave it the dogs, as least they are enjoying it.",1
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",This is a temporary bed for my 5 year old.  We recently moved and couldn't take the Ikea bed with us.  My kid loves this bed and the best part is that it is foldable and fits into a corner or under a bed.  Its pretty sturdy and of excellent quality.  Just don't jump on it!!!,5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","These cots worked great for our 3 year old grandchildren at our summer home however, one of them broke on one side.  I think the weight of them possibly standing on one of them enabled one of the pieces to snap.  We still use the cot however, it was a minor piece that broke.  I will write to the company to see if I could get a replacement part.  All in All they work great and the kids loved them.  We used sleeping bags on top of them.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",And his mommy and daddy also love it.  I did good buying this for them. They are missionaries and will be traveling from church to church for the next 5 months sharing their work in a foreign country.  My little grandson will be comfortable every night!,5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","I ordered this for my 3-year-old to use as she's recently outgrown her portable crib. She really loves it and I love how portable it is. I can see this item being used at picnics, the beach as well as overnight stays. What a great idea and amazing how small it is when folded up and stowed!I wouldn't use this for more than a few nights. It's not plush in anyway. It would be great to use with a sleeping bag or with a quilt under it. Check the weight limit as well to make sure that it's going to work for your child.",4
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","I have a children's room set up for my grandchildren when the stay over.  It has a trundle bed, a toddler bed, and a crib.  The baby will sleep in a cradle with Grandpa and I.  The children's room is on the second floor.  I use the cot with either a pink or blue nap mat for the younger children to nap during the day. This is great and folds easily an compactly away when it's not needed.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",I think the cot was a great find for our trip but with 1 washing & using it for a week the sheet is already ripped in several places by the elastic.  They need to use better material. Not sure what I'm going to do since a twin sheet would be way too big.,2
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",it was received as directed.  It is sturdy and well fit for a toddler. xo xo xo xo xo xo,3
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","My son will not sleep when sleeping away from home.  He cries, won't go to sleep and tells us how he wants his choo-choo bed (he has a Thomas the Train toddler bed).  So, in trying to decide what to do, we settled on this cot.  I brought sheets from his bed and blankets - he got right in bed and went to sleep - both nights!  So happy we found something he will sleep in while away from home!",4
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","For the small car owner with kids there is very little as intimidating as the pack and play. For years I had to avoid it and either get the hotel crib or the family one bought by relatives for when we arrived. Not this year. I took my cot to Florida and had room to spare.Assembly: None.Setup: VERY simply. Just pull apart the beams and there you have it. I did add more padding under the sheet via another blanket.Comfort: My three year old took to it right at bedtime, no complaints, not even on the first time.Space: Folds relatively small, didn't take up massive space in my hatchback. Also lightweight to carry.Glad I purchased this.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","I came across this product while searching for a safe place for my child to sleep while we were vacationing and at her grandparent's house. This cot is so great and she absolutely loves it!  It is extremely easy to assemble.  You simply take it out of its carrying case and pull the opposing corners out to stretch the cot out.  She had no complaints to the comfort of the cot, but we did place a camping mat under the sheet provided with the cot for extra comfort.  The cot does not turn over when she decides to sit on just one side and stands up to her rough-housing with her stuffed animals. After tons of research, this cot was the most affordable and, I must say, that it has exceeded my expectations with regards to comfort, ease of use, and child approval.  I would recommend this to anyone for vacation travel, camping, or overnight visits to the grandparents.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","We bought this for our 2 year old to use on a recent trip since he is now sleeping in a big boy bed, and he loved it.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","Easy to use, no hassle, compact,  sturdy. I would recommend this product to anyone with kids they don't want sleeping on the floor.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",Its the perfect size for lil ones. It is super light weight and literally takes 5 seconds to put away! I love it. The only thing i added was a little mattress pad for her back and she sleeps like a baby! lol all in all its a wonderful product at a great price :),5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",This a great product however the seams were it folds are already ripping so I am very disappointed that it didn't not last long,1
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","This is a great idea for a very small or young child, for an older child (over 4) this may not be the best idea as the fabric starts to sag over a bit of time and your child will soon be sleeping on the bars.",2
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",I brought this to transition by three year old out of my bed!  It is great but for every night sleeping it is hard!  So I went to a fabric store and bought a foam pad to put on top.  That has made it a lot better.  Also the sheet that came with it is made out of thin cheap material.  I will have to make a new one.  Other than those issues it is a good buy!,4
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",Our 2 yr old grandson was coming for a visit and he had outgrown the Pack n Play.I heard about a child cot and found the Regalo cot on Amazon. I purchasedthe one with the fitted sheet that came with it...It worked great. He slept well in it.and liked it.we did fold up a blanket under the sheet for a little more support for him.,5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",We recently received our Regalo cot and my toddler LOVES it. It's very lightweight and easy to open and close. The fitted sheet is very well made. My only two complaints are that I wish the cot had a locking mechanism while in the open position. It kind of closes up when my daughter sits on the edge of it or climbs on and off. A lock would be nice so it STAYS put while open. Also the travel bag has no handle on it to carry the bed and it's VERY thin. I'm sure it's gonna rip after very little use. Besides those two things this bed is nice and very convenient to use for travel.,4
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",The center of the cot has this raised part (reinforced seam?) that looks very uncomfortable for kids to lay on right at the waste area.  Had I known about that I would have not gotten it.  My kids used it once and never again just sits in the closet. Waste of money.,2
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",My daughter loves this! It's not very padded but she doesn't seem to mind. I have a napper that goes on top of it to make it a bit cozier. It's super lightweight and easily portable,5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","I found one of these at a local yard sale, and never imagined it would be so useful. Now with two kids, one wasn't enough. Camping, napping, or just hanging out on a pint size piece of furniture... this cot is a great option.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",This is perfect for our 3yo daughter when we are traveling and visiting family.  We would definitely recommend it. Easy to use and comfortable.,5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",My grandson loves this portable cot.  It is very handy and easy to set up.  The cot is not very long so will not work for very many years.  It feels like a cot so I add a sleeping bag to make it more comfortable for overnight.,4
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",My daughter loves her new cot! She has no problem sleeping in it! She gets excited to go to bed when we are traveling. :),5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","I was iffy on getting this for my 2 yr old becsuse I worried it wouldn't be comfortable enough for him, but he loves it!  We used it on a recent trip and he slept in it each night.  To reiterate what others have said, there is no longer a bar in the middle so the cot is pretty flat.  My son is a bit tall for his age and he had plenty of room.  He surprisingly fell off of it twice, but it's so close to the ground that it didn't bother him at all.  This cot is super convenient and great to travel with!",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","My 18 month old son loves sleeping in his little cot. It is very convenient to take to multiple babysitters, or on road trips. It packs up quickly and easily and does not take up much room in the car. My only problems with it is it is rated for kids up until 5 years I believe and my son will outgrow this much quicker. It also has a very poor carrying case, the little cinching clasp has already broken in 2 wks of use. I am going to make one with a shoulder strap on it and cord pull close.",4
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","Great toddler bed... my 2 yr old grandson loves to sleep on it when he comes for a visit.  My daughter has one that they take with them when traveling, vacation, etc.;  sturdy, easy to step-up and store.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",I was in a hurry and didn't pay enough attention to the length of this cot.  Therefore I was surprised to get it and find that mygrandchildren will only be able to use until the age of 6-8.,3
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","My 16 month knew exactly what to do with it when we pulled it out to show her.  She climbed right on.  I checked for a middle bar, and didn't find one.  I brought it with me to her daycare and she had her first nap on it that day--she slept for 3 hours!  (Very long for her, her max is typically 2 hours).  Good construction, obviously comfortable for her, great buy.  Highly recommend!",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","This is wonderful. Wasn't sure of the size or of the comfort rating when we ordered it, but our 2 yr old daughter loves it whenever she wants to lay down for a nap, or go traveling to the grandparents, GREAT alternative to a pack and play which we've used up tll now.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",Great for toddlers but would love something similar for larger child or an adult.Could be great for travel or camping.,4
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","I cannot believe that this cot has not been taken off the market.  As some of the other reviewers have mentioned, there is a strap that runs across the middle of the cot and essentially makes sleeping on it like sleeping on a bed with a couple of 2x4s running straight across your back.  No parent who loved their child would make their child sleep in this most horribly uncomfortable item.  I know, you'll be tempted to ignore this based on the good reviews.  Buy at your own peril.",1
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",I liked the cot that my daughter bought for her daughter when they traveled so much that I had to buy one for her to use when they visited grandma's.,5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","My daughter's first bed aside from her crib. Bought it for a vacation, she loved it. I was worried about pinch points, but as long as the little ones aren't folding it up, I didn't see anything that concerned me.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","Arrived as expected and in great condition.  Comes with a blue sheet.  My son, who is 4, set it up by himself and slept great.  Easily fits back in carry case.  Compact and easy to transport.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",The cot folds up easy and comes with a sheet.  I purchased it for when my granddaughter was over for the night.  It didn't look real comfortable so I put foam between the cot and the sheet to make it a little softer for her.  My granddaughter loves it.,4
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","I have used this several times since I purchased it for my two year old grandson.  Except for a center strap that bothers me but not him, I have no complaints about this item.  It sets up easily---he can open & close it independently.  The mattress cover that comes with it washes well and retains its' fit. Great quality and price.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","We purchased this cot in Sept of 2013 to take to our trip to Disney World for our 2 year old to sleep on. (Big family, not enough beds) My son is a larger 2 year old. He weighs approx 38 lbs.The cot comes in a carrying bag with it's own sheet. It is very similar to those cloth folding chairs and super easy to set up. Just pull it open and press down to flatten it. I was impressed with the quality of this cot considering the price. I thought it would be adequate for the trip and that we would likely never use it again so I wasn't very concerned with durability however that thought went right out the window once we got home.The cot worked wonderfully for our vacation! He loved having his own private bed and was excited to go to sleep every night.We do not use the sheet that came with the cot. We use a crib mattress protector that is pretty thick to add some padding and protect the cot from accidents and a crib sheet. That gives his cot a &#34;personalized&#34; look that makes him even happier to sleep on it!The cot does warn you to NOT JUMP on it. However, a 2 year old is not going to always heed to these warnings. We have to yell at him frequently to not stand, walk, or jump on the cot. He has not broken it totally but he has caused some damage. The two points on the sides that connect to the frame have started to tear. The cot is still usable but if he continues to jump on it he would surely destroy it. If a child jumped on it for an extended amount of time it would definitely tear and be useless.My son is afraid of sleeping in his room. So nightly he comes into our room in the middle of the night and sleeps on his cot. It has held up well for this.I HIGHLY recommend this cot and advise to use a crib protector if you have a young child that has night time accidents.",4
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","My niece loved it!  We actually used it as a bed frame for her; I put a crib's mattress on top of it to make it a bigger bed for her (did not tell her of course, she is 5 and would not have lied down on a crib - LOL) - but it worked wonderfully- used twin sheets for the bed, she is under 50LB but close - held her weight just fine.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","I was in desperate need of a travel bed for an upcoming trip, but I was worried about the negative reviews regarding the ""bar"" on this bed. Totally not what I experienced. There is not even a fabric band on the middle of the bed- there are X supports at the top and bottom (underneath, with nylon webbing) but nothing is uncomfortable.In fact, it's exactly what I needed for my five-year-old, 40 lb daughter. Fits her perfectly and I can't wait to use it on our trip.And it's SO easy to set up- you just push on the end pieces are BAM it's done!",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","I'll start by saying I have not used this cot much yet.  I usually think people who review items without using them are a bit unreliable as sources of useful information, however, I will write about my first impressions.  I bought this cot to replace the Playhut Disney Princess/Cars Slumber Bed that seems to be unavailable everywhere I look.  Compared to that particular cot this one is much shorter and will not last my 4 year old long before she becomes too long for it.  My Disney Slumber Bed held my 8 year old for 5 years before it finally gave out and I needed to replace it with this one.  So my main disappointment was the short length.  It seems that the construction will hold up as well and the lumbar support is much more comfortable than the Disney Bed.  The reason I gave it 4 stars is because the sheet it comes with is very scratchy and made of cheap fabric.  I read a review that said it was soft, so maybe different packages just have different sheets, but mine has the feel of an old dish cloth.  However, that problem is easily fixed and does not affect the performance of the cot.  I got out my infant's pack n' play sheet and it fits the bed perfectly.  So if you have any old ones you can unearth them for this cot and give it a more comfortable feel.",4
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","We purchased the Regalo My Cot Portable Bed in preparation for an upcoming trip with our 2 & 5 year olds. When the item arrived, it had a big tear in the carrying bag. We took it out of the bag and set it up to allow our children to try it out prior to leaving. Within 20 minutes of our 5 year old laying on it, we heard a big snap and one corner of the bed collapsed. The plastic piece had snapped in 3 pieces, making the bed totally unusable. Our 45 lb. 5 year old is well below the maximum 75 lb. weight limit that this bed allows for. Paperwork included with the bed states to contact the company directly with any issues, so that is what I did. My call was answered quickly, but the person answering the phone told me that there was no one available to help me. She offered to listen to my concerns, but quickly told me to &#34;just return it to the store where it was purchased.&#34; No apologies, no offer to help me, just a quick response to basically let someone else deal with my problem. I contacted Amazon, and they quickly refunded the money for this item and contacted UPS to come pick the bed up for a return. Very disappointed in Regalo, but thankful for Amazon's quick response. Do not purchase this bed-- the quality is obviously lacking.",1
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","Great cot, I use them for daycare and they are very comfortable. Mine tend to start folding up a little if the kids move around too much.  It actually doesn't seem to bother the kids at all, but I would prefer it to stay flat while being used.  Some kind of latch or lock that could be released when it is time to fold them up.",4
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","Love it, I ordered 4 of them and my children nap well. High recommended to childcare, campings, sleep over with friends",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","My son loves this cot.  It's great for anything -- snoozing in the living room, sleeping in a hotel room, napping outside, etc. It is very sturdy and has no annoying bars in the middle.  It collapses instantly into the nice small included bag.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","This cot is as adorable as it looks in the picture. Bought it for my 18mo. old grand-daughter to sleep on when she visited us for Christmas. It is well made, easy to set up. folds small, and has a washable removable sheet! Great buy for grandparents who need something rarely, and then need it to be easy to store away the rest of the time. We love it-- and so did the little one!",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",I bought this for my grandson.  I love it .it is so worth the money.  I keep it down stairs. He takes a nap on it. He loves it. It's his bed away from his crib.,5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","So far, so good!  We've used  this several times for travel for my 2.5 year/old.  I wouldn't say she loves it, exactly (she would rather be sleeping in the big bed) but it's a great, convenient solution for a kid that has outgrown a pack n' play.  It comes with a sheet, which has washed well, and seems reasonably comfortable.  No bar in the center - that design flaw has been corrected.  Love it!",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",I left this at daycare. No issues at all. My baby slept fine in this cot. It's low enough that I'm not worried about him falling off.,5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","This little cot is perfect for traveling! Our little guy loves sleeping in it, it is comfortable and folds up very small for easy packing. The price is so reasonable I would buy one for each grandparent! Perfect too for extra little house guests, or hotel travel when sharing a bed isn't practical but sleeping on the floor is less than ideal. This is about 6 inches off the ground and very lightweight.. I just wish it was a little bit longer, our four year old is 42"" and I am afraid that by this time next year it will be too small.",4
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","Amazing light portable bed.doesnt take too much space,very light and obviously pretty comfortable,my son slept on it without any problems.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","We bought this when our toddler grandson decided he was too grown up for a crib. At home he sleeps in a toddler bed and we knew he'd resist going back into a crib when he occasionally sleeps over at our house. He's a restless sleeper and isn't quite ready to spend a night in a regular twin size bed. The Regalo cot is similar to the ones used at his day care. It sets up in less than a minute and is sturdy and long enough to accomodate him as he grows. It's low enough to the floor so that he can get on and off without assistance and he won't get hurt if he falls off.We paired the cot with an inexpensive sleeping bag and when it's bedtime, we make it a ""camping"" adventure for him. Grandma likes the removable, washable cover that is supplied with it and the way the cot folds into its own bag for storage.PROS: Compact, lightweight, sturdy, removable and washable cover; comes with a storage/carry bag. Easy to set up and take down. Great for travel and occasional sleepovers.CONS: We haven't found any yet.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","I purchased this cot for use when my 2 year old nephew sleeps over. He spent a weekend with me recently and absolutely loved it! I was apprehensive as to whether or not he would sleep in it all night. I was thrilled when he did and upon waking in the morning he just hung out for an additional 1/2 hour relaxing on the cot and chatting about his ""big boy bed"". I did pad the cot with a quilt and put the sheet over that as other reviewers recommended, otherwise it appeared it would be uncomfortable.",4
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",This is the perfect travel bed when visiting family out of town. I love that it folds up and has it's own bag.,5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","We travel frequently and often host guests. Without a guest room, having this cot allows us to give her double bed and even her room at night to grandma and other guests. This bed is compact (slides under the regular bed at home; light to carry on plane; takes up half the room folded as an umbrella stroller) and comfortable enough for our daughter to sleep in as needed. Crib/toddler bed sheets fit it perfectly. We do need to pad it a bit with a blanket under her fitted sheet. It's also great for smaller toddlers because it cradles a bit -meaning that rolling out would be near impossible. I only wish it were a little longer so that she could sleep in it as she gets older, but I am sure there are similar products out there for older kids. That said, my kid is 4 and 90th percentile, and I think she's got a good 6+months of use left with it.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","Mom and Granny love this cot.  Our toddler is a little squirm bug in his sleep.  He's not quite ready to sleep in a big bed, or at least we're not ready to have a fall out of a big bed!This cot is perfect!  It's lightweight and it's low to the ground.  If there's a fall out of the bed, it's only 8 inches or so.  That's a lot less a fall than from a regular bed.  It's good practice for when we transition to a full sized bed.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","The cots are a little small, so I was worried my 3 and 5 year old wouldn't be comfortable on them, but they loved them.  The only problem is, after using them for their bed for 50 days (August 12 through September 30) one of the metal tubes broke on one of them.  I noticed because one side of the cot is now lopsided, and upon further inspection, found that one end of the broken tube had gouged out the wooden floor beneath it.I have mixed feelings.  On the one hand, I really liked it.  On the other, it broke after less than 2 months.  But then, maybe it isn't meant to be used as a bed, only as a once-in-a-while thing, like on camping trips.  Still, in the end, not very pleased with the outcome.",3
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","The concept of this portable, fold up and very convenient toddler cot/bed is brilliant that is short lived when you realize while prepping it for your child, the way it's constructed when it's spread out? the very middle of this bed is raised up so your child can't lay-sleep comfortably flat?! my child has to curl up of simply lay uncomfortable! this product is not made to lay down & sleep rather for a sitting down either on the left or right!",2
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","We bought two of these to take camping and our kids LOVE them.We also use them for sleepovers, in hotels, and for some naptimes.  We've used them moderately for about 6 months, with no issues.  Our 3-year-old is a very easy on hers, but our 5-year-old is rough on his and it's still going strong.PROS...It's inexpensive, literally sets up in SECONDS, folds away in SECONDS, and very portable.CONS...The center has a strip of nylon webbing to keep it from sagging into the support bar.  But since the rest of the cot sags, it creates a firmer line in the middle.  My kids don't even notice it, but other kids might be bothered.OTHER...For the negative reviews who say the cot is small...the measurements are available in the description!  Obviously, if your child is taller then the cot (48"") then they won't fit.  But if you need a portable or fold-away bed for a young child, this is a great investment!",4
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","We purchased this bed for our 2 year daughter because we do travel several times a year and she no longer will sleep in her pack-n-play. The bed set-up quickly, however there is a thick band in the center similiar to the support bar on pull-out couch bed.  My daugher was very uncomfortable and said that it hurt her belly and back.  She ended up sleeping with us.  It is a good concept by the design for comfort is lacking.",1
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","I ordered these cots for my two 3-year old twins.  The are absolutely fantastic, they setup in less than a minute, and are very easy to move around/collapse.I ran into an issue which is why I had to give these 3 stars.  I know it's not random since it's happened twice.  There is a small plastic knob with a metal screw that holds the cot fabric to the frame.  There are six of these per cot.  Two of these have broken on me so far, and there is no way to fix them.  I was able to get some hardware from a home improvement store to fix the cot, but I haven't had the cots but a month before they started breaking.I contacted Regalo (the company that creates these costs) by email and never received a response.Other than that, these are great!***Update, I contacted Regalo for the third time, and they finally sent me the replacement parts I needed.***Another update, These knobs continue to break off.  Good thing Regalo sent me six of them, I'm quickly using them up!***Out of knobs, I found an alternative method to attach the cot to the frame.  I went to the store and bought some small, black cable-ties.  They work great, and don't need to be very thick.  The only problem is you have to cut them to remove them.",3
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","I used to pack a bulky portable crib for my toddler for out of town trips, but no more. This is light, folds up easily, truly portable. works for me!",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","My 3 1/2 year used this for a week (both for bed and the few naps we could con him into) and I heard no complaints (and he was even excited about using it).

"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","After moving my 18 month old to a toddler bed he refused to allow a foot inside of a pack-n-play.  We needed something for him to sleep on when traveling so I ordered this to give it a shot.  It is PERFECT!!  I have a small travel blanket i put down underneath him.  Along with a pillow, his ""Mickey"" and his ""blanket"" he thinks he is at home in his own bed.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","Both my boys, 3 and 2 love this cot. They sleep well on it overnight in hotel rooms. Best part is the cot fits perfectly between the wall and the bed in hotels, so there is no room for roll offs! Need to purchase another one!!",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","My son goes to a special school, and they liked them so much they got one for every student! they fold up perfect, and are so easy the kids take them up and down, and they are comfortable! I would lay on it! My son says he loves it!",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","We have 6 year old triplets, and we travel by car quite a bit. The kids stay in their beds and fall asleep easier when they are not in one bed altogether. So these are great. They are comfortable! SUPER easy to put up! And easy to store. We had been bringing portable playpens, but they had outgrown them -- we were very happy to see these.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","We travel with our toddler quite a bit and this is an excellent, easy to carry, cot for any sleeping arrangement! So much easier than taking a crib mattress! Make sure that your toddler can get up and down from things, I had her sleeping in this at about 2-years old. I think before that age they are still unsteady and may fall out of the cot. It is low to the ground and with a bottom blanket for extra padding is a life saver in hotels, grandma's house, and when you have guests. Great buy!",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","If I could give this product zero stars I would. Well, not the product but the company. I too encountered the same problems as others who have reviewed this company.I ordered my product, it said it was shipped AND delivered but it never arrived!! Not to mention when I placed the order it stated there was no tracking on the bed. But after I did not receive my item and checked again it showed a tracking number, which turned out to be a FALSE number that did not lead anywhere.I called the company several times and received no answer (in fact the first time I called the mailbox was full-probably from other complaints- so I couldn't even leave a message. When I was finally able to get a hold of someone he was so rude to me. And his response to everything I asked was &#34;I don't know&#34;. He then told me my product was on back order and would not be shipped for six weeks! And they only told me this AFTER I went looking for my product that i paid for. They NEVER would have told me my item would be two months late (if arrive at all!) If i had not gone looking for it. This company is a sham at best.When I asked for a refund the rude man on the phone then told me I had to file with Amazon because they would NOT refund my money!! Terrible company. No customer service. Don't waste your time or your money.",1
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",Got this for my nephew who loved this cot. Very sturdy and with stand jumping on it from the little ones.,5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","This bed is very sturdy and it works for our small grandchildren.  But I thought it would be a little longer, even though it gives the length of the bed when you guy.  All in all, I like it because it folds and stores when you don't need it.",4
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","Our 2.5 year old girls have outgrown their pack n plays and we were looking for something for them to sleep on when we travel.  These are fantastic.  The girls fit on them well and slept through the night on them.They are a canvas material, similar to what you see on camping chairs.  They come with their own fitted sheet you can wash.  I used that, but also put a toddler bed size fitted sheet on top of it to make it softer.  Because it is a cot, it bows a little in the middle, which seemed to be enough to keep my girls from rolling off onto the floor.  They slept on them for 4 nights and didn't roll off once.The legs are designed in such a way that even when your child lays down, the cot does not rest on any of the legs (no bars in your back).  I was worried about that when I saw the design, but it was not an issue.They fold up sort of like a camping chair (of course a little bigger).  It is much smaller than the pack n play was folded up, which helps with the packing.  You simply pull the bed out of the bag, open it, put the sheet on, and you are all set.  There is no assembly or set up.  You just open and use it.  It folds up just as simply and is easy to get back into the bag.I would highly recommend it to anyone traveling with toddlers.Update:  We ordered this in February of 2013.  Here it is October of 2013 & my girls have outgrown it.  In all fairness, we probably kept them in pack n plays too long.  But, on a recent trip, in trying to turn over, one of our girls rolled on the floor.  They were just about the right size for it, as long as they didn't move.  We tried them in a bed together on our last trip, lined with pillows.  We had a little learning curve & a couple falls out of bed (I know, same problem as the cot), but by the end of the week, we figured it out and feel more confident next time we travel.  I would make sure you have enough of a window to use it, or have more kids coming up (we just have the twins) to make the purcahse worthwhile.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","we brought these to the beach for the 4 years to sleep on in the parents bedrooms. They loved them! need to add a blanket for padding, but they were a great size and comfy. material is vinyl, brought them to the beach for babies to sit on off the sand, hard to keep them on there, but great. also bought some for the dogs for outside dog beds to keep them off the concrete/grass and not on the patio furniture.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","This is a great little travel bed for a toddler.  Much lighter weight than a pack n play, but it does required getting your little one to sleep in a bed where s/he can just get out and walk away if they are so inclined.  Once we got our son to sleep, he slept very comfortably.  Seems like sturdy construction and will likely last a while.  Great value at only $20!  Gives your kid their own special spot when sleeping away from home.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","This is a great item but the bag that it comes with has no handle to carry and the plastic piece to pull the cord broke in half the first time using. Must of been cracked before I used, broke very easy. I would buy this again just wish it had a handle to make it easy to carry.  I bought 4 and the kids love them.  Good luck.",4
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","I needed a bed for my grandchildren when they come to visit.  This one sets up in seconds.  When folded in its accompanying storage bag, it takes up very little room and is easily stored.  I would suggest putting extra padding on it before covering with a sheet.  The metal frame can be felt through the canvas.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","These cots have a strap sewn into the middle that doesn't stretch enough to make the cot perfectly flat to lay on.  Maybe if someone was heavy enough it would stretch, but my son is as tall as the cot is and he didn't weigh enough to sleep flat.  We ended up using a blow up bed for sleep and will be returning them.  The picture of the 2 kids sitting at the beach is probably more what is intended for this product.  Sitting, not really sleeping.",2
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",I purchased two of these about a year ago for my grandsons to use when they stay at my house.  They love their beds and so do we.  They are so easy to store and to set up and we have also taken them on weekend trips.  They are very sturdy and show wear after regular use by a two and three year old. I highly recommend these.,5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","I intially ordered one for my 3yr old son who loves it and it is so easy to extend out and fold back like an accordion and the cot comes with a sheet, but you can use any crib sheet too if the original becomes worn. I did not see an issue with the framing, it appears to be very sturdy. It is stamped on the cot's material ""no jumping,"" so if that tells you anything, my son has put it through the ringer until we told him its not for jumping. I loved these cots so  much I ordered 16 more and donated them for my sons Preschool. I noticed when the childrens prepared for nap time they slept on mats on the floor, which is okay and not a problem, but I thought it would be nice for them to be off the floor. The Preschool staff LOVE them!! They thought these were the coolest and cutest thing ever and all the children love them. I was initially a bit hesitant to purchase due to some negative reviews, but I just chalked it up that the difficulties were due to factory defects as with any product that you may purchase and slide through to the consumer. However, I love these cots and recommend them for your child for travel, preschool or just to play with at home. They are awesome!!",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",Love this product.  Great for daycare AND home use.  Comfortable place to nap.  An awesome buy for the price point.,5

"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","We bought two of these for our grandchildren to sleep on in our bedroom when they spend the night.  The children are 3 and 6 and they love having their own little beds.  My granddaughter did say something about the bed being hard, so we bought some one inch thick foam from the fabric store to put between the sheet and the cot, and now it is fine.",4
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","Item arrived very quickly!  Set up in an instant and very easily.  Nice bag and good enough sheet.  I will put a soft blanket under the sheet as was suggested from others.  This is a newer model...no support bar in the middle, but 2 large woven x's for support.  Grandson hasn't slept in it yet, so I will reserve that rating until he does.  It appears to be level...no dips, or the head/foot being lower as some have mentioned.  The price was very fair and if it holds up for a year or two, I'll be happy.  I like that it's very portable...much easier than taking down the pack n play type units. (which I have several of)  This cot should allow me to change the sleeping area as needed since there's a little brother now, too!  Check back for my final review after it's been slept in a few times!",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","We bought this for our 3 year old when he outgrew the pack-n-play for trips. It's a great concept, very easy to transport, folds very small, and he loves it. But, after sleeping on it twice, he complained (the 3rd time) that it hurts his back (he weighed 31 lbs. at the time), and the cot had sunk a bit in the middle so that his back was right on the middle support bar. Like other posters here have written, the middle is up higher than the head and foot area, so it's very uncomfortable and digs into his back. We've done like the others have mentioned. . . put pillows and/or rolled up comforter underneath the entire cot (and over the brace) to make it all an even surface to sleep on, but it's a lot of trouble. We're going to sell it and buy a different cot. The design of this one needs to be reworked.",2
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",We are approaching our one year anniversary of owning two of these cots for our two young children. The cots are holding up very well. We have taken them tent camping numerous times and have hauled them to the grandparent's house. In addition to the ease of providing a comfortable place for our little ones to sleep they make a great extra bed during sleepovers.The cots fold up small and easily store under a toddler bed or a twin size bed. They take up less room then a folding camp chair in your vehicle. They are durable and have with stood hours of sleeping and many additional hours of being a place for our son to sit and play during rain storms while camping. We are rating with five stars.,5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",This is perfect for when my grandson spends the night.  I added a sleeping bag on top of it to make it a little more comfortable for him.  The size of the cot is perfect right now.  I should get another year use of it before my grandson outgrows it.,3
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",Perfect for my out of town trip. My 2 year old loved it! It folds up really easy too. Could fit children up to 6 or 7 years old,4
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","We got this for my 3 year old son to use when sleeping over at our families houses. He had no place to sleep except the floor so I wanted to get something he could use for a while and be comfortable in. First off, I was very relieved to find that there was no bar in the middle of the cot. The bars are underneath the cot and no where does the cot lay on top of any bars. It is low to ground which is nice, if the kid happens to roll off its not a far drop. The size is great. I wish the cot was a little more comfortable with some padding or something but it's a standard cot. My son used it for the first time to stay at a family members house when we weren't there and we were told that he slept on it throughout the night and even walked back in later the next day and laid down to take a nap. Its also great that its compact, light and portable.",4
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",I bought this for my son a few months ago. We just took it to Disney to use and after the first night the metal bars broke and it cannot be used anymore. My son is below the weight limit listed. I would not recommend this products,1

"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","This is a great cot.  I purchased it for my daycare kiddo, and it was a hit.  They sleep very comfortably, and have to complaints about a bar in the middle causing discomfort.  The sheet it comes with is a plus!  Great product would recommend, and I will be purchasing another for my newest daycare addition!!",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","I bought this for my two year old to use for camping trips or when we have family in town and need to give her bed to a bigger person. Fits her perfectly. Definitely not for big kids (like probably good for kids up to about 5 years old, but if they're tall, maybe not).It's lightweight, folds up like a camping chair and fits nicely into its little sack. She's slept comfortably on it a handful of times already and it's been great. The little fitted sheet that comes with it is nice because it's washable. The only thing that I don't love about it is that it's made of a similar nylon material as those folding camp chairs, so when she tosses and turns at night, you hear the ""swoosh, swoosh"" of the nylon. So if you're tent camping next to a little one that likes to toss and turn, you'll need to be a sound sleeper to ignore the sound (though many sleeping bags make the same swooshing noise too!)Overall, a great purchase and for the $[...] it cost, it was well worth it for camping while at home too.",4
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","It is lightweight and compact. However, there is one primary center support that runs the width. It is very taught and tighter than the areas at either end. As a result, it creates a bar that the child's back wraps over leaving their head and butt in the saggy parts at either end. I am so surprised that parents rated this so highly. Would you really be comfortable in something that does not offer consistent support the entire length of the cot?  I saw one review where there used to be a bard in the same center location that was replaced... but the replacement doesn't address the bend in the cot part. I am returning it and made the decision within a few minutes of opening the product. Too bad as it would have been perfect as the better cots are 3x the cost. Guess it doesn't pay to cut corners. I am going to try the Go-Kot.",1
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","First off, our toddler LOVES this cot. He was crying today because he broke his cot! He's only 2 and under 40lbs and has never jumped on it. But he does stand on the corner before he lies down on it, which is exactly where the thin-walled tubing cracked and broke. It was a Christmas present and lasted exactly 6 months. It traveled well (even fit in my large suitcase no problem) and was great for light use. But my boy loved it so much (especially in warmer weather) that he started using it all the time. And that's where this product fails. Summary: Great product for occasional use but flimsy construction doesn't permit day-to-day use.*UPDATE* Regalo identified this as a manufacturing defect that was addressed and fixed in later models. They are sending a new cot free of charge. Great customer service! I have increased the rating from 2 to 4 stars. Thanks Regalo!",4

"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",I ordered 3 of these for my in home daycare. I've had them for a couple of weeks now and the kids love them! My 4 year old son actually slept on one this last weekend for a sleepover in our living room and he thought it was pretty neat and said he was comfy! They are so easy to set up and take down I have some 2 and 3 year olds who can do it! Only thing I thought was odd was one out of the 3 I ordered came in a different box and it actually in my opinion isn't made as well. It sits couple inches lower and the sheet is poorly made compared to the other 2. So I am thinking about ordering another but I'm not sure what I'm going to get? All in all so far so good with the kiddos!,5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","I just started a daycare and needed toddler beds. I wanted something I could fold up, was small,and easy to use. Kids love them. Sleep great.

I worry that my 2 year old isn't enough weight to keep it from trying to fold up again. But it's a great size, wonderful construction and the carrying case is fabulous! After first use, my daughter ended up on the floor (she may have crawled off herself), but it wasn't too far of a drop to wake her up. Takes up same floor space as a standard crib mattress, so make sure you've got room where you're going to put it. Perfect for light use and traveling!",4
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",We got this cot for our kids because we travel a lot and live on a lake.

"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","Bought this for the 2 yearold to sleep on when we went on vacation, Its handy that it folds up but the kid just slid around on it and fell off and there is no way this thing is comfy either.",2
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","Bought this for my nephew.  He loves it and so do his older brothers.  They are too big for it though. It holds their weight, they're too tall. Now I'm tasked with finding them some bigger ones.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",I read the reviews and still bought 2. I figured they sell many so there's got to be an easy fix if the tabs do end up breaking. Well after my 3yr old son laid on this to watch a movie not even 2 hrs later he was sleeping and his head was sunken into the bed at an awkward angle (very unsafe). I moved him to he couch and inspected that the plastic tab connecting the metal frame to the canvas bed had cracked off. This is unacceptable as my son weighs 33 lbs. I swear he did not jump on it or stand on it as I warned them these were for relaxing on only. I tried looping a couple zip ties to hold the canvas to the frame but was unsuccessful. There is just no place to attache them properly to the metal frame since it has no hole in it. I suggest that they replace the cheap plastic tabs with matching metal tabs that go with the frame and they might have a great and safer product. I contacted Regalo-baby the company regarding this issue. They are based out of Minnesota 866-272-5274,2
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","** NOTE: I purchased this late March 2012. I believe I have an updated model as compared to the description of the product in previous reviews. **Now that my kids are a little older, my wife and I plan to do a little more traveling. Unfortunately the entire family sleeping in a large king sized hotel bed is becoming less of an option. We decided that purchasing travel cots/beds would be the solution.There were some key features we were looking for:* First, we wanted a bed that was economically sound :) I'm sure anyone reading this who has more than one child understands that when one kid gets something, the others have to have the same. In our situation we would need to purchase 2.* Second, we wanted it to be compact when stored as we have minimal vehicle space already. As with the previous note, we would need to cram 2 into the car.* Third, ease of assembly.* Fourth, durability. This and the previous note pretty much does away with an air mattress. I've had plenty of air mattresses in my time and convenience and durability have always been questionable.In searching I came across this one and another one that was very close to fitting the bill. Unfortunately the other one cost more than twice what this bed cost. considering I had to by 2, the choice was obvious.I was a little concerned about some of the previous reviews. They have noted that the center support strap is too tight and it creates an elevated section in the middle. This would obviously make the bed uncomfortable to use for anyone who had to lay across it. There were enough positive reviews that I decided to go for it and see if I couldn't adjust the bed to make it more comfortable.I am happy to say that the bed is better than I had expected. Especially so because of the cost. As I have noted at the start, I believe I have an updated model. Perhaps Regalo had read all of the more negative reviews and took them to heart. There is no strap in the center but instead there are criss-crossed straps on both sides (I have attached pictures so you can see how it's supported now). There is still a slight hump in the center from the tension of the fabric between the two center supports but it's not bad. My little girl doesn't mind and she actually asks to sleep in the bed each night.Hope this helps anyone who is thinking about buying this. Honestly you can't beat it for the cost.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",My son likes this cot.  it's easy to fold and store.  setup is very easy as well.  has a washable cover which is a plus,4
"Regalo Maxi Super Wide Walk Thru Gate, White",This gate isn't a pressure mount.  It's definitely not portable.  It pressure mounts onto plastic things that you SCREW into the doorway.  No thanks.  I'm disappointed that it was misrepresented in the description and I'll be sending it back.,1
"Regalo Maxi Super Wide Walk Thru Gate, White","I have this gate up in my home to keep my dog locked up during the day. He is a 70 pound Black lab, and this gate works perfectly for what we need of it. The gate opens and closes to prevent us from having to step over. I think this product is very handy and works great for the price.",5
"Regalo Maxi Super Wide Walk Thru Gate, White","Had to align it just right, otherwise the gate doesn't shut. Torn right out of walls several times. Doesn't take into account height of baseboards, have a book wedged underneath the middle to support gates.",2
"Regalo Maxi Super Wide Walk Thru Gate, White","Gate is sturdy, really nice looking and adapts to our extra-wide stair opening. Even when the little monster shakes it and tries to tear it down, it stays put. We mounted into the walls and this gate is going nowhere. Out only fear is that he figures out how to catapult over. That's another story.",5
"Regalo Maxi Super Wide Walk Thru Gate, White","It seems like a fairly sturdy gate, we bought it to keep our 80 lb dog out of the kitchen. I don't care for the latch of the gate and the gate opening is narrow.",3
"Regalo Maxi Super Wide Walk Thru Gate, White","I ordered and received the Regalo Maxi Gate a few weeks ago, but have been unable to install it because the diagram in the instruction manual does not match what was shipped. I called the phone number on the manual, only to find out that the number had been changed. I did get the new number and called it, but the canned response just said the office was closed--no information about when the office was open. I am going to send the gate back if I do not hear from someone in the next day or two, and will contact Amazon to find out if I can get back my return shipping, as the product is relatively heavy and will cost a fair amount to ship.",1
"Regalo Maxi Super Wide Walk Thru Gate, White","This was perfect for confining our two new crazy dogs to the kitchen area as they run in from the back yard.  It is well-made and strong, just what we needed!",5
"Regalo Maxi Super Wide Walk Thru Gate, White",This lasted outside through 4 NE winters.  I just replaced with same brand/type of gate. Use to keep Min-Pin in either front or back yard.  He does not jump on it.  Not the strongest gate for a small child or a dog that would try to jump against it.  But is just what we needed and held up outside longer than we thought it would!  I recommend that Amazon sell the extensions for this gate also.,5
"Regalo Maxi Super Wide Walk Thru Gate, White",It is not as wide as I thought it would be.  I do not like how it is made or how it goes together.,2
"Regalo Maxi Super Wide Walk Thru Gate, White","Although this gate may be suitable for wide openings it does not take into account moldings on the wall or thresholds so it has pieces that are supposed to be mounted to the wall but it requires it to be in the middle of the molding so that half of it is not touching the wall. It also has a piece for the middle of the gate that should go in the middle on the floor, but if you have a threshold then the gate again won't be able to support this piece and won't be able to install properly.",1
"Regalo Maxi Super Wide Walk Thru Gate, White",My three year old figured out how to open this in about two seconds.  It holds my 1 1/2 year old twins back (but not the three year old).  I guess this might be good till they are about two.  Then you will have to lock it with an additional lock (what I do).,3
Melissa Doug Mirror Flip-Flap Color Toy,"My daughter got this as a gift at about 10 months of age and could have cared less. The ""satisfying clicking sound"" was not so satisfying. She did like to chew on it while teething and was interested in the mirror for a minute, but overall it just sat there. The quality is excellent as Melissa & Doug products always are, but I can't say that I'd recommend the item as more than a teether.",3
SwaddleDesigns Baby Lovie - Polka Dot Flannel with Bright Blue Satin,"Half of our house is tiled and my two year old likes to carry his regular blankie around with him when he is tired. Problem with that is he trips and slips on it and falls on the tile. SO I got this thinking maybe if he could have a blanket that wasn't dragging around his feet on the tile it would be safer. And I had been looking everywhere for a smaller one that didn't have a stuffed animal attached to it. It has worked wonderfully. No big blanket off the carpet, but the little one he can carry anywhere. I LOVE the bright blue color too.",5
"SwaddleDesigns Baby Lovie, Plush Dots Security Blanket with Color Trim, Pastel Blue",This swaddle design baby blanket was perfect for what I intended it for.  A small blanket for my baby dolls I build.  I will buy more,5
"SwaddleDesigns Baby Lovie, Plush Dots Security Blanket with Color Trim, Pastel Blue","When he stirs in between sleep cycles at night, about half the time he'll go back to sleep if he can find and grab back onto this blankie.

"SwaddleDesigns Baby Lovie, Plush Dots Security Blanket with Color Trim, Pastel Blue","I received one of these as a gift, and it is just the softest lovie ever!  Another great product from the people who make my favorite blankets!!!!",5
"SwaddleDesigns Baby Lovie, Plush Dots Security Blanket with Color Trim, Pastel Blue",I ordered a blanket for my new grandson who is due to be born any day now and this is not a blanket. It is very tiny and is smaller than a burp cloth. Very disappointed customer.,1
Brandee Danielle Ribbit Toy Bag,"I love this little bag.  It's hanging on my daughter's wall now.  The straps to hang it are thick and sturdy, and the material is very high quality.  I'm very happy with this product.",5
Kids Line Leap Froggie Rug,"This rug is very nice. It has a great non slip backing that actually works! My 2 daughters have walked, run , & crawled over it...along with my 2 cats & dog...it still looks wonderful!",5
"SwaddleDesigns Baby Lovie, Pastel Security Blanket with Chocolate Brown Trim, Lime","it's a perfect size and washes and dries well, so we love it, and it has been her favorite since she was very young (now 3). This is the third one we have purchased, in a panicked moment we couldn't find #1 and #2 so quickly hopped on Amazon to order #3. Of course quickly found #1 hours later and #2 reappeared a couple days later. Better safe than sorry, maybe one will go to live as a backup at Grandma's house.",5
"SwaddleDesigns Baby Lovie, Pastel Security Blanket with Chocolate Brown Trim, Lime","This is the best blankie I have come across. Very well made and so soft. Soft and fuzzy on one side and soft and silky on the other. Whether your little ones like silk or soft, you win. I thought my son would love the silky side and actually ended up loving the soft fuzzy side.  He always has at least one with him when he is tired, sleeping, or upset.  He loves them! They are the perfect size for a security blanket. He has 4 of them and I am buying 2 more.",5
"SwaddleDesigns Baby Lovie, Pastel Security Blanket with Chocolate Brown Trim, Lime","Perfect, pricy, soft, cute, washes and dries well! I would buy these again in a heart beat, just wish the price was a little lower. I opt for the ""kidsline"" brand.",5
"SwaddleDesigns Baby Lovie, Pastel Security Blanket with Chocolate Brown Trim, Lime","My son has been basically permanently attached to this lovie since he was about 4 months old.  We first got it as a shower present, and have since purchased it about 7 times!  It has a lot of great texture, and it holds up really nicely, wash after wash.",5

Zooper Disco Teal Three Wheeled All terrain stroller - Everyday Line,"This stroller is pretty nice.  It seems to be high quality.  It was so easy to put together!Pros:~front wheel rotates or can be locked forward~comes with a winter boot, rain cover AND sunshade~nice blue color, but not teal in my book~adjustable height handle~nice 5 point harness~reclines all the way back~adjustable footrest~removable front bar~zippered pocket on the back~decent sized cargo basket, easy to get into~very adjustable attached sunshade~easy to push~fairly easy to fold~fits in my trunk of my mid-sized carCons:~wouldn't accomodate a tall toddler~no parent tray, just a little mesh water bottle holder~no child's snack trayMy daughter is 17 months old and is 32 inches tall.  She will outgrow the stroller in another 3 inches.  Her head will literally be touching the top of the sunshade.  Overall it is a nice stroller!",4
Zooper Hook-On- Chair Navy,"I absoultely love this chair. The fasteners that go under the table were a little tricky the first time I used it, but after that it was really simple. It folds flat so I can store it under the passenger seat. The only table this chair hasn't worked on was a wooden picnic table at a park.",5
Zooper Twist Teal Lightweight Umbrella Stroller - Everyday Line,"I did a lot research for an umbrella stoller and I accidently came across the Zooper Twist while I was checking on line.  I have to say I'm soooo glad I took the chance and purchased this stoller.  It's really light and sooo convieniet!! My son who is 16 months old likes this stoller better than my Bumbleride!  I feel so much better when shopping because the stoller fits every where.  The only thing I wish it did have was an adjustable canopy.  It does come w/ a sun viser that you put over the entire front of the stoller but my son just plays w/ it and it comes off.  Also, I wish the handles were adjustable for my husband he istaller than me.  Oh yeah a better cup holder but not a problem.  I would highly recommend this stoller!!  Very sturdy and well made too.  It has all the comforts of a bigger stoller but compacted in a umbrella style.  Which makes life a little easier.",5
Zooper Twist Teal Lightweight Umbrella Stroller - Everyday Line,"For the price how can you go wrong, it is absolutely FULL FEATURED, besides a lot of features of the stroller itself, you get a uv shade cover, a raincover, and a cover for the legs (the boot; useful when it is cold). Easy to open and close, a breeze to push, I can even manage with one hand, baby is happy in it.  Only wish it could recline with one hand. The two buttons you have to press to recline the stroller, get a bit stuck on ours, but maybe 'cos it is new. Even if I knew that would happen, I still would buy this stroller, it is something I can live with. It is almost half the price of the 2007 models, which only differ from the 2006 in color and fabric. The color though is not really what I expected from a teal, it is more of a dirty blue.Update on October 23: We have used this stroller for 6 months now and it still works great, the recline buttons are still sticky but other than that everything it works fine. I do however wish that the seat was a bit higher. The seat is as low as the Maclaren triumph and Quest (I always compare the height when I see other strollers near ours) but the Peg Perego Pliko P3 (and maybe Pliko lite or Peg Perego Aria) have a higher seat and the plikos as well as the Chiccos (C5 or C6) have a MUCH smoother push. Personally I still would probably choose this stroller or possibly the Chicco C6 'cos of the much much lower price. The Chcco C5 only comes with a rain cover and does not come with all the accessories that this one comes with.",5
Zooper Rocker Navy,"I bought this bouncer before my baby was born, and it looked great on his room, I just got good comments on it. I could start using it until he was 5 months old, because the belt on it is not very safe for smaller babies... he leaned to the side and it seemed like he was going to fall.One day he was sleeping on it and we heard a loud sound. It was the bouncer, my baby was still asleep, with his feet up and the head almost touching the ground on the back.(way lower than the feet)... Nothing happened to him, but I think it's very dangerous and Amazon should consider not selling it anymore.The look is awesome, it's clean and simple, and looks great, but my baby only used it for less than a month before it broke, and I think that the safety of the baby is more important than the looks..",1
"Baby Jogger Performance Series &amp; Q Series Single Sun, Wind &amp; Insect Protector","This definitely keeps the sun and bugs off my baby and is a perfect fit for my baby Jogger Q Series, but it is a medium/dark gray color and the weave it quite tight (not like a mesh) so it is hard to see through. I have to stop and put my face up to it to get a good look. That wouldn't stop me from buying it again since my main goal was to keep the sun off my baby.",4
Leachco Easy Teether - Crib Rail Cover - White,"I really like this cover because it is simple and sleek. I have another one that I purchased from Babies R us on the opposite side that is much bulkier and it is more cream color (the only color available) which does not look good against my white crib. This cover is whiter and doesn't hang down as far. The top of my rails are pretty small though, so if your rails are thicker at the top, this cover may not fit. The previous crib I owned had round edges on the rails and I am positive that it wouldn't have stayed on, especially with baby pulling on it.",4
Leachco Easy Teether - Crib Rail Cover - White,"I would not recommend this item to anyone, unless they have at traditional style crib.  The new crib styles do not fit with this teether crib rail cover.  I didn't know that and purchased it, opened the item and tried to put it on and it didn't fit.  I couldn't return it because it was open.  I don't think it's a good item.",1
Leachco Easy Teether - Crib Rail Cover - White,"This product is great!  My daughter had started chewing on the crib rail when she woke up from her nap, but this cover put an end to that!  It's easy to put on and fit well on my crib!",5
Leachco Easy Teether - Crib Rail Cover - White,"I love this product! My one-year-old decided to start teething on his crib rail, and we all know that crib manufacturers only cover the TOP of the rail with plastic...do they just not know about those bottom teeth? My son was chipping the paint off like crazy, and it was driving me nuts! I looked at other products that adhere to the crib rail, but I have no intention of damaging my crib any further, so I went with this one. Well worth the money! My son no longer teethes on the crib rails, and he is entertained by the toys I can hang from the cover while he is settling down for naptime. I would highly recommend this product! (I have a white crib, and this cover looks nice on the side rail.)",5
Leachco Easy Teether - Crib Rail Cover - White,A good buy for your little teether.Does as described and prevents your baby from gnawing at cribrails.It fastens with velcro so you may fing your child has figgured out a way to peel it back.Still good for the price,3
Leachco Easy Teether - Crib Rail Cover - White,i returned. it wouldn't fit around my crib rail. Velcro also wasn't strong. i would not recommend even if it did fit.,2
Leachco Easy Teether - Crib Rail Cover - White,"My daughter bites the crib rail from time to time. But one day I found there are some scraps out. I ordered this one immediately then problem solved. Since it's a little bit expensive, I give it a 4 star.",4
Leachco Easy Teether - Crib Rail Cover - White,"Have tried and tossed the gummy plastic rail cover - my daughter chewed on it and the adhesive started coming off, then moisture started getting underneath... not good.  This is a much better alternative for us.  I like that I can throw it in the wash and she doesn't seem to even want to chew on the fabric, which was the plan!  Very happy with the product, quality and results.",5
Leachco Easy Teether - Crib Rail Cover - White,"Doesn't fit sleigh bed style cribs, or any crib with any heft to the rail.  Had to modify to fit over the crib rail.  Just o.k.  Better description would have been helpful",3
Leachco Easy Teether - Crib Rail Cover - White,"This didn't fit my rails at all, plus it is very short - i'd have to get 2 to protect 1 side.",1
Leachco Easy Teether - Crib Rail Cover - White,This product worked really well for us.  After trying 3 other crib railing protectors we finally found this one and it's getting the job done.  Our 13 month old has learned to paritally unvelcro part of it but overall it's getting the job done (a little too late though since our entire crib rail already has teeth marks)!,4
Leachco Easy Teether - Crib Rail Cover - White,It fix our oversized crib and saved the wood.  My son had just started to chew when I found this.  I tried the gummy crib rail cover and it didn't fit and truthfully I don't think that design would be effective at all.This product is a much better design.  I like that is is wahable and the toy loops are a big plus.I love and will recommend it to others.,5
Leachco Easy Teether - Crib Rail Cover - White,My 9 month old (she was 8mths at the time) was chewing the crib rails. This completely covered over those exposed rails and allowed her something less harmful to chew on. It's also neat that there are loops to hang toys. Nice added feature.,5
Leachco Easy Teether - Crib Rail Cover - White,It works well for our Sorelle Rosa crib which has relatively thin bars and hidden hardware.  The covers are a couple inches short for the length of the crib but this works well since cribs with hidden hardware also have bars flush against both ends of the length that would have made it hard to pinch off the last bits of velcro.  Note that the velcro attachment extends the full length of the teether cover.Also worth noting is that the material can be bunched up for the attachment of a cozy crib tent.  This takes out the extra length provided in the attachment strips of the tent while giving a bit more volume to teether cover.  It looks seamless to the casual observer.We're still waiting for the baby but the product looks quite durable and the initial wash didn't cause any pilling.,4
Vilac Push Along Mini Race Car,"I bought this for my son after he kept asking for one (a picture of them appeared in one of his books) every day for over a week. I wasn't aware that you only get one race car, so that was a disappointment when I opened the package. I wish the description was more obvious, or that we could at the least pick the color of our own choosing.That all said, it is made very well and does seem that it would last for many years. My son however was disappointed in the color we got, and quickly decided that he was no longer interested in it, or the picture of them in his book. I would only recommend buying this if you absolutely love it. $15 seems way too steep for so little options and to only get one...",4
Vilac Push Along Mini Race Car,"these little cars are of excellent quality and great looking!! very nice as decoration, and kids can play with them too",5
Vilac Mini Taxi,"The pieces were not attached together well, which poses a threat to a 1-yr-old child.  I returned one and had another one sent to me by Moolka, but the second one was worse than the first.  Vilac has not responded to my direct email.  I've returned both busses.  What a shame.",1
Happy Stroller's Swiss Strolli Rider by Bibi of Switzerland,"Our family has had the strolli rider for about 3 weeks and we are in love with it!  Our three year old was not interested in riding in the stroller until we adopted our second daughter!  We didn't want to get a traditional double stroller for so many reasons, firstly cost, secondly the sheer bulk aspect and thirdly...well, lets just say it would be Murphys Law to buy one only to have our three year old tell us she is no longer interested in riding in the stroller!  The sit and stand strollers are much larger than I had hoped and the buggyboards weren't ideal.Then we saw this...it was easy to insert the coupling for the type of stroller posts(it comes with assorted shapes for different strollers), and it takes less than 30 seconds to put on and take off...my daughter LOVES it and calls it her ""mountain bike"".The only caveat is that people will stop you wherever you go and ask where you got it!You can fold down our stroller with it attached, but we tend to take it off and on because it's so easy.  I'm larger build and still dont feel like I need to walk off center to the stoller.Overall one of the best products on the market!",5
Happy Stroller's Swiss Strolli Rider by Bibi of Switzerland,"I purchased this after trying 2 different buddy board-style riders. They were so awkward, our ankles took a beating and the children still had to stand when little legs were tired. This is so much easier to use and fun! We get comments wherever we go. The two older boys (grandsons) take turns on the StrolliRider that we have fondly nic-named 'The Hitchhiker' while the baby rides happily. They all love it and it sure saves everyone's back from aching! It trails along with no trouble, taking corners smoothly and leaving our ankles alone. I just can't recommend this highly enough. You will love it hands down, and your children will too. In fact, I'm thinking about getting another one for the other side of the stroller since 2 new (grand)babies will soon be joining our family.",5
"Parent Units 2 Pack Topple Stop Furniture Straps, White",I used this unconventionally to secure two shelves in my travel trailer and it worked well.  I screwed the connector to the wood.  I'm not sure I would trust the stick'em for something heavy if I couldn't screw it in.  That would be my only concern.,4
"3-Pack &quot;I Love&quot; Drooler Baby Bib, Pink-Daddy",These burp rags are long but kinda narrow. Only as wide as my babie's head so if she turns to the side or moves her head while burping her it spills off the side. These are good for babie's that spit up in the car seat though. I fold one in half and tuck it under her chin to keep the spit up off her and her car seat. Not very good for every feeding though.,3
Sesame Street Wipes Travel Case (Each item is sold individually),"This case is sturdy and holding up over time, but I also see it as unnecessary considering half of the time I forget it and use a baggie anyway.

Sesame Street Wipes Travel Case (Each item is sold individually),"I received two of these for my baby shower and they are super cute, but they only closed completely a few times and now they will not stay closed, so the wipes dry out.

"Luvable Friends Applique Feeder Bib with Teether, Blue","I first purchased the Creative Genius one and then just went back to order the train since we were so happy with the purchase.  It seemed rather large at first for our 4 month old, but it definitely still works for her.  It was easy to wash and dry when some other bibs sometimes take longer to dry. I just wish they had some slightly better designs -- but from a functionality perspective it's great.",5

"Luvable Friends Applique Feeder Bib with Teether, Blue","Our 6 month old was 10.4 and 22 inches when he was born, then doubled his weight and added another 5 inches in his first 2 months. So he's a big boy! And he started teething at 4 months, so it's been really hard to find bibs big enough for him that are also appropriate for his developmental level. He doesn't need the plastic ones with the pocket food catchers, he just needs really big, absorbent, waterproof ones. And these bibs are AWESOME. Totally worth the price. They are nice and thick, and have a huge neck hole. I love them. He's only recently figured out that the rubber on the corners is for him to chew on, so not much to say about that, but I've really appreciated the size and absorbancy. Just to be fair, they WILL soak through if left on for too long. I've literally ordered about 10 of them, and we rotate through around 4 a day to let some dry out.....",5
"Luvable Friends Applique Feeder Bib with Teether, Blue",I bought this for my grandson's first birthday and my daughter loves it because it is bigger than most bibs and is very cute.  My grandson does chew on the corner teether occasionally too.,5
"Luvable Friends Applique Feeder Bib with Teether, Blue","This bib is colorful, thick and I loved the idea of the teething corner on it. A little pricey for a bib but should get a lot of use out of it.",5

"Deck Shield Netting, Clear, 30 Feet x 35 Inches","I would not recommend this product for outdoor use.  I am writing this review approximately ten months after installing this product on my deck and it is completely disintegrating.  I actually took it down this evening because I was tired of cleaning chunks of it out of my yard.For the cost and time it takes to install, I would definitely consider other alternatives.  The reason I installed this product is b/c there is a large gap at the bottom of my railing that we were concerned our son could fit through.  I will now be installing new balusters -- yes, at a higher cost, but I could have put the $100+ I wasted on this product toward the new lumber.",1
Baby's First Year Keepsake Stamp Pad Calendar in Blue,"this calendar is perfect.  you make it your own, i've completed it for two of my children and LOVE looking back on the first year.  i tracked everything in this! first foods, first visitor, first sickness. the stickers are great and the ink pad is such a great idea.  ive given this two times as a gift as well and each person adored it.  as a new mom you dont have much time to ""record"" things, this gives you a one stop place to write it all down.  i even attached thier christening invites, favors, birthday invites and favors, birth announcements all in the front cover.",5

"Cardinal Gates Edge Cushion, Ivory","We use this cushion almost everywhere in our house for kids' proof. Most of our furniture are black, so black edge cushion is a perfect match. It blends it very well with our furniture (dinning table, entertainment cabinet, bed frame, etc). It also comes with strong double side tapes.",5
"Cardinal Gates Edge Cushion, Ivory","I baby-proofed every sharp edge in my living room with this tape, and it does the job. It's a bit difficult to apply, and the adhesive is not super-strong, which is good if you don't want to permanently baby-proof your furniture, but bad if your baby decides it's a fun toy, because they can pull it right off. Also hard to put around corners, but I got around it by cutting a slit where it went around the edge.",3

SnuggleWool Infant Car Seat Cover- Universal Size,"I just received this in the mail and like the first reviewer am highly disappointed.  The wool is very abrasive.  Also the backing is polyester.  I viewed this product from a couple of different websites before purchasing it and not once did I read that the back was polyester.  I was informed that I did not look close enough as I found that was true.  Though, I did find myself annoyed that it was not stated in the description.  Unfortunately it seems to be one of the only wool car seat covers on the market.  I am trying to return it now.  I'll try to update this to let you know how that goes.  I am finding that my attempt to be satisfied with the product by washing it according to their directions will ultimately mean I used it and therefore will not be able to return it.  We'll see.  As an update to returning it: I was pleasantly surprised by the seller, Serendipity Shopper, on how well they handled my disappointment and truly bent over backwards to make sure I was satisfied.  Ultimately, they took the product back.  Thanks",1
BROWN 24 Inch Length Extension for Metal Hearth Pad,"With a Christmas visit from a new toddler grandson coming up, I wanted a way to protect him from falls into our large raised stone hearth.  The measurements for this product were too small for the length of our hearth, so I ordered the extension kit.  The pad worked fine as far as being protective, but I was unable to figure out how to put it together with the extension.  I am fairly mechanically-minded for a girl, but this was beyond me.  So I had to call in the troops (my husband), and it even took him a little while to figure out how to make the thing fit together properly so that it would cling to the hearth properly.  Actually, he ended up going down in the basement and getting some kind of extra piece of metal to sturdy it up so it would stay together.  However, once it was finally mounted, it stayed on like a charm, and we were very glad it was there, as our toddler fell into it more than once, saving a nasty bump on the head, I am sure. As long as you are ""handy"", I would say you would be happy with this product overall.",4
"Cardinal Gates Corner Cushion, Brown",They are great.  When my grandson comes over I don't worry about him falling and hurting himself on the table corners.,5
"Cardinal Gates Corner Cushion, Brown","First the positive -- the brown cushions fit our coffee table perfectly, will definitely protect our lil one from injury, also they are aesthetically pleasing.However, the tape is completely horrible and considering you need the cushions to stay on --this is a significant issue. Both my husband and I messed with the tape for nearly an hour before we were able to get it to stick, and even now, I am fairly certain that my daughter will be able to rip these off.",2
"SnuggleWool Lambs Wool Pad, Crib 28x52","My granddaughter (7 months) and her Mom share a room in the finished basement. Our winter here in Chicago has been extremely cold and I was looking for way to keep the cold off the crib mattress without haveing a corded device in the crib (that thought just scared me too much). Well, this totally did it. My granddaughter loves it, from the first night we put this on the mattress she started sleeping through the night again.",5
"SnuggleWool Lambs Wool Pad, Crib 28x52","I thought it was going to look/feel more natural. At first I thought it was all synthetic, but I guess it's natural.

(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,"We have very long windows that are low to the floor in every room in our two-story house. We've been on the hunt for a good window safety product for a long time. Anything else wouldn't work because of our window coverings - wood blinds and roman shades. This one is perfect. It's adjustable and I hardly notice it, but I have pushed and pushed on that window to try to shove the guards out of place and I couldn't make them move a bit. We will be ordering more for sure!",5
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,These do just what I wanted-keep my second story double hung windows from opening more than 4 inches.  Easy to install.  I have not had any problems with them.,4
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,This little device successfully stopped my 5 year old and 3 year old from opening up the windows.  We have white window so the device sort of blends in and they can't move the window.  I love that it comes off fast in-case of an emergency and if the window is forced by an adult hand it would pop off.  Perfect item for someone who doesn't want to drill into their windows.  I highly recommend.,5
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,"Our new house has front bedroom windows that come nearly to the floor. The grandkids were scared when we left them open, anyone or anything could get in easily (we live where there are critters.)  These wedges work nicely to keep the window from opening more than we want, and they pull off for an emergency if we needed to exit by window.",5
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,"I think this is a great invention.  Our house was built in 2006 and the windows are very good quality windows, but for some reason they don't have those little pop out locks that allow you to open the window a few inches.  In my last house we had these pop out locks and they were great.  The only complaint I had was that they were not adjustable as they were built in to the window and they only allowed you to open the window about 2 inches.  I had been looking for something similar so that we would be able to leave our windows open a few inches during the day and night to get some fresh air.  We watch a lot of crime shows and my mind is always racing thinking about how easy it would be for someone to break in when our windows are open by cutting the screen, and we wouldn't hear a thing.  Therefore, we never really open our windows.  Then I found these.  I ordered 2 packs (4 locks total) and they work great!  They are adjustable, so you can open the windows as far as you want.  I have mine set at about 4-5 inches because I cannot imagine anyone being able to fit through that amount of space.  They are easy to remove as well.  You simply pull the wedge off the velcro and voila!  This is great because on those nice breezy days we can still open our windows all the way, and then close them to a few inches at night.  I am not concerned about the velcro losing its stickiness because I figure I will just buy more velcro and stick on the window.  Not a big deal to me.  This gives me peace of mind and I think its really a great idea.",5
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,"I've used this for a few months now.I like it, it works. Set up took a minute.Put one on each side of the panel and that should make itvery difficult someone from the outside to pull the window.Con:It can't be moved so be sure you measure how high you want the windowto go up on a regular basis.",5
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,this is a good product for some. in some of my windows the lower pane just slide over the wedge ans couldn't really hod it tight in place. whether it is a problem of the width of my windows or the product I am not sure. but works on some.,4

(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,"This product was the answer to my need to ensure the safety of my impulsive four year old daughter with our second floor windows.  We have wood windows from 1989, and I didn't want to be making holes with screws.  The window wedge doesn't require any screws, installs in under 1 minute, and definitely ensures the window won't open.  With our windows, we found that only one was necessary per window, and the windows aren't opening.  I don't believe my kids will even attempt to disengage the lock - other reviews mentioned that kids easily moved the wedge and opened the windows.  I also didn't let them see me install the velcro or the wedges.  Thank you for a great product!  Now I'm ordering more for the rest of our second story windows!!!",5

(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,"I bought a few of these on the advice of a friend and I am glad I did!  I live on the ground floor with windows that open wide.  After one break-in into my apartment I was scared to leave the windows open, even when I'm home.  I was scared for my life!  My landlord stipulated that I can't make modifications to the apartment, so bars were out of the question.  A friend of mine told me about these wedges and I got them.Today I left the bathroom window open (with the wedges in place set at 4 inches) while I went shopping.  I came home and tried to close the bathroom window, but it was tight against the wedge.  This means that there was another attempted break-in!  The wedges worked!",5
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,"From a purely cosmetic perspective, if you have white window sashes, the wedge really blends in well.  However, once you apply the velcro adhesive to the frame, you should figure it will be there for good, since I tried to peel one off, and the paint came with it.From a functional perspective, it seems to work well, so I hope that my kid doesn't outsmart it while I am not looking for 5 seconds....",4
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,"If your child is tall enough to reach them, it doesn't take much force to pry them from the Velcro, and totally defeat the system.  However, I got around this by tilting the lower window (of a double-hung) in, and applying the wedge to the outside.  Since I don't think our child knows how to tilt in the window, nor is strong enough to pull the catches, this solution should work.  You just need to be careful.  Defiantly not a useful option for any child over 5 or 6.  You'd probably need something requiring a key at that point.  (and of course, you'd need a key accessible in the event of an emergency)",5
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,The window wedge is great for not only security but for baby proofing. With the edge in place you can not get the window open.,5
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,My son at 3 years old was able to climb on the window sill and unlock the window and pull the two wedges off their Velcro strips and then climb down and open the window.  This happened in a matter of less than 5 minutes of him in his room supposedly having quiet time.  They would work better for windows that only slide open side to side.  Ours are vertical so the wedge was much more accessible.,1

(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,"These did not work for us.  I wish they did.  The tape sticks to the window frame just fine, but the piece that is supposed to stop the window just slides along the velcro when the window is pushed against it!  It seemed to work when I first applied it, but after the first test, it just kept falling off the velcro tape. Now I have to return them an figure out another way to keep my kids from falling out the windows.",1
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,works very good and easy to install. anyone can do it. it protects anything from the outside in. i recommend,5
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,"I'm writing this about 30 minutes after seeing my 4 year old in his 2nd story room with his window wide open, and the two plastic window wedges we had installed in his hands.  We had the wedges installed on our fairly new vinyl windows, as well as having them locked with the two sliding lock mechanisms attached to the window.  When I asked my son how exactly he managed to open his window, he simply told me he had climbed onto the window sill (the window sill in his room is about 18"" from the ground), unlocked the sliding locks, and pulled off the ""plastic thingys"" (referring to the window wedges).  We've had these installed since he was about 18 months, and up until then he hasn't even noticed them.  But once your child gets curious enough to put any effort into opening his/her window, the window wedges don't provide much of a challenge if they're at all determined.  They pull off of the velcro easily, and were visible enough for my son to figure out why the window wouldn't open all the way when he tried.  Luckily, I was able to catch this before anything bad happened, but I am on google now looking for an alternative, and will nail the window shut if I have too.Basically, they're good in theory, and for younger kids who just need a mild deterrent from opening a window, they should work fine.  But for an older child who likes to figure out the mechanics behind why they aren't able to do something, these window wedges are easily figured out.",1
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,"The means of attaching to a window was pretty straight forward, it's a velcro strip that's parallel to the line of the window/door opening and closing.  The velcro connection is pretty weak between the wedge and the window, but is good enough to slow opening of the window.In my case, it's more used as a deterrant rather than a full on locking of the window.  So I'd use it more as a case of being on the back door which would give me enough time to stop my son from opening the slider door in a quick manner.  He'll eventually being able to force it open, but will at least give enough time to keep the dog from running away.It does the job for my purposes, but if someone is going to use it to keep the window from ever opening you might want to invest in a means of protecting the window locks or something that drills into the window.",4

SnuggleWool Baby Blanket 27x36In. Cotton Flannel Bk,"I am not sure what to think. Since I was only able to see this ONE that I actually purchased in person, I don't know if it is normal or not for the wool to be so - kind of coarse and not so snuggly. I had this impression that it would be soft, fluffy, comfy, snuggly - but it's rather stiff and coarse. I've tried to wash it (correctly I am sure), I've been gentle with it - but it's been this way since out of the bag. Perhaps mine is defective or I did something wrong - I have no idea or anything else to compare it to.Baby seems to sleep better now that I've taken it OUT of the crib as well - so this didn't work for us - plus it's pretty expensive. Wanted to love it - but didn't.",3
"Dream On Me Full Size Play Yard, Gray","The colors may not be to everyone's palate if you want a play pen that would match your home decor as it is garish; but if you don't care about color schemes, I would definitely recommend this product.

My six month old sons rolls around in it, and I feel very confident leaving him there to play while I attend to my daily chores.",5
"Dream On Me Full Size Play Yard, Gray",Worth the price and quite spacious. I can take it with me wherever I go and baby is not excluded because he can see through the mesh  sides.  Really happy with this purchase.,5
"Dream On Me Full Size Play Yard, Gray","I would have given this item 4 or 5 stars for how easy it was to put up and take down and the pattern, but it had such a strong chemical odor that I had to return it.

When putting it away, pull floor up first.). All in all, this is tons better than getting a fancy play yard that costs twice as much...you'll likely never use the extra stuff on the expensive ones...",5
"Dream On Me Full Size Play Yard, Gray","I'll start off my saying we only used this play yard for 10 days on vacation.  The price was so good we ordered it to be a disposable sleep solution instead of having to deal with flying with our own.  It was very easy to install and it is quite roomy so it met our needs.  The cons were I was uncomfortable with the mattress being an inch shorter than the play yard, it seems like a big health risk, especially for a smaller child.  And I also felt like the mattress was kind of lumpy and very hard.  I ended up wrapping it in a towel beneath the sheet so it wouldn't crackle every time my little one rolled over. Also, and this is a matter of personal taste, I found it very gaudy, like having the circus in the house.  They are all very bold, very different colors, so this is not a play yard I would choose as a permanent fixture in our home.",3

"Dream On Me Full Size Play Yard, Gray","The pay yard itself seems quite well made.  I would have rated it a 5 except for the directions--especially about how to take it back down.  It took me a long time to figure out that, at the middle of each top bar, there are two hidden latches (one on each side of the hinge) that must be squeezed up from the bottom of the cross bar in order to unlock the hinge.  The directions to &#34;lift up&#34; and &#34;push in&#34; do not describe the unlocking action very well in my estimation.  Other than that, highly recommended.",4

"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass","I guess it depends on how it fits with your door like some other reviews mentioned, but for me it fit like a glove and seems very secure. I'm very pleased.",4
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass",The metal screws are of low quality (soft metal) and also painted (which does not help with installation - screwdriver is slipping on the paint). The instructions are wrong - the drill bit sizes recommended for drilling holes in the door frame are clearly smaller than they should be.,2
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass","I was a bit reluctant to purchase -- only 2 prior reviews. But was pleasantly surprised.Pros:+++ Sturdy, all metal polished construction (cleanly machined surfaces, no burs, etc.)+++ Simple installation (""template"" style mounting + ability to ""pre-test"" lock prior to installation)+++ Remarkably well-written instructions (worth nothing since many are poorly written)+++ Design makes this lock likely suitable for almost any door that opens inward (only, as advertised)+++ Easy and intuitive to use; when engaged it clamps your door shut firmly with very little ""play""+++ Looks good (though obviously that's just my opinion)Cons:--- A bit pricey--- The strike plate ""replacement"" installation option didn't work for meI am ok with the price given how sturdy and finely crafted this lock is. I did see a few less-expensive locks of conceptually similar (""flip, block"") design but they didn't look as sturdy.Regarding the last point the # of screw holes and alignment didn't match our door strike plate so we couldn't install there, but in fairness they don't really push this lock as a ""strike plate"" replacement and I didn't buy it for that so I don't consider that a sufficient reason to reduce the rating on this product. In our case even had that option worked we wanted it mounted higher specifically to keep it out of reach of our mischievous twins.Bottom line: Highly recommended -- I'm very happy with this lock and buying a 2nd for another door.201207 Update: Have successfully installed 2 of these locks and they work great. If you pay attention to detail during installation (which is reasonably easy to do) these locks provide a tight, secure latch for your doors. After months of use found no wear and tear, e.g., the finish is still shiny and unblemished. Have a friend w/young children who needed the same capability who bought the same lock and was quite happy with the results.",5
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass","Very nice childproof lock. I got the brass color, which is an antiqued gold color, which goes well with our existing hardware. We had to notch out a portion of the door to install, which we did not expect. It's basically like a really high deadbolt.",4
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass",Love this door lock. It blends in nicely with our white door frame. Feels secure and offers some amusement when friends come to visit and can't figure out how to open it. Would recommend to anyone looking for a cleaner for stop than a chain model.,5
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass",Easy to install and use.  Makes me feel a bit safer to go along with my deadbolt and alarm system.,5
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass","We added to the top of our doors to keep our 2 year old twins in the house. Works well. Looks much nicer than the chain locks. Installation did require that we put holes in the side of the door jam, but those will be easily filled if we ever wanted to remove.",5

"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass","Product works really well. Better than expected. It actually looks quite elegant. However, I spent way too much time trying to find out how product mounts, how it works and how antique brass color was going to look like. Antique brass color per company website is black and is closer to antique bronze than the color shown in their website. Out of sheer luck color worked out for me. Mounting instructions PDF file is horrible and their marketing packaging image is awful  too. Their marketing guy needs to talk to a packaging engineer. Last, the product had a few rough edges that should have been smoothed out on process. Low quality process but apparently good quality parts. I can live and work with the drawbacks of product. Would buy again.",3
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass","I'm very happy with this purchase.  I purchased this to keep my 3 year old from opening the outside door because I think the child proof door grips are ugly and too easy for him to figure out.  The Door Guardian was very easy to install, blends in with my door, and is up high enough that my toddler cannot reach.  Even though I did not buy it for security reasons, I actually do feel more secure with it latched.  I have purchased more and will be doing all my exterior doors.",5
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass","Forget those cheap door guards, latches and chains.  I highly recommend the Door Guardian for your home security needs.  The installation was very simple; however, I had to use shorter screws on the wood door frame.  The 3"" screws were way too long for my situation - I believe the 1.5 or 2""  screws from Home Depot work just as good.  I had placed mine approx. 6"" above the dead bolt lock.  I also have one of those door guards that hold up against the door knob and the floor.",5

"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass",it arrived quickly.  Packing was fine.  No complaint with shipping.  It doesn't fit our door.  The lip of the lock hardly hits the door.  Not worth installing.,1
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass","Bought this to keep my kids from opening the door and I LOVE it. Only downside is you can't open the door from the outside if it is locked on the inside and I locked myself out because of that. My oldest daughter can easily open it, but the younger two can't. Another plus is I didn't have to drill any new holes in the door which is nice since we are renting, I just removed the existing lock plate and put this one on instead.  Would recommend, just remember to unlock it if you go out the garage and shut the garage door after you or you too will get locked out. =)",4
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass","For added security, a door guardian is a must. Gives me pece of mind and the best is that my toddler can't open the patio for.

I only used one there, and I could not break open the door even if my life depended on it, and I'm 5'9&#34; 220 pounds pretty fit.I put 2 on my front door and now have a great piece of mind knowing that probably only a car driving through my front door will break it open.I recommend this lock to all my friends and family.Also looks great with any of the finishes it comes with.",5
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass",This thing does its job.  Its great for young kids who tend to open doors. Secure and easy to install.,5
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass",Installed at my front door after our 30 month old figured out how to unlock the door. Easy installation and sleek finish is why we chose it. Good value too.,5
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass",It looks nice and keeps my child from opening the front door. We bought a second one for another entry door.  It also provides a little extra security from intruders.,5
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass",The Cardinal door device provides extra security and peace of mind especially when our young grandchildren are visiting.  Great product.,4
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass",best ever!  works great!!  easy to install and my baby won't be getting out the front door without me knowing.  the videos really sell the product well.,5
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass","works well, use when your home, seems very secure just keep in mind it doesn't work when your away if you use that door for exit.simple, easy to install with a bit of cutting on molding strip, direstions easy to understand",5
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass","When our 2 1/2-year-old figured out how to open the front door I bought two of these for our front and back doors as extra safety. We live on a road where people routinely go 20 mph over the speed limit and we are also at the top of a hill with limited visibility when approaching from either direction. I needed to know she couldn't get outside. These seemed pricey but fit our needs and I love the added security they offer as well.The locks are heavy and feel solid. I bought a white one and a brushed nickel, they both look great but the white did have a small mark on it in the package. It's not noticeable unless you're looking for it. My husband installed one lock in 5-10 minutes, the second one we did need to chisel the frame a bit to get it to sit right but even then it couldn't have been more than 15 minutes to install. We've tested them with some pressure and they've held up well. The way they're installed I think they would hold up if they were ever truly tested but for our main purpose of keeping our toddler in they will definitely work. You have to use a certain maneuver to unlock them so even if she scales something to reach the lock she probably won't be able to unlock it. I think they were worth the money. I have peace of mind!",4
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass",my oldest child has special needs and door guardian is a lifesaver!,5
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass","This lock is pretty tough. It is secured by 3 long screws, which anchor it very firmly into the door frame. For the doors that don't have deadbolts, this is a great inexpensive option. I would certainly buy more if needed.",4
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass",My husband installed this lock on our back patio doors (French doors) in about 15-20 minutes.  He did need to chisel away part of the frame but it's totally worth it for the peace-of-mind it gives us.  Our 3 year old grandson is very adventurous and the thought of him getting out without our knowing was keeping me awake at night.  This is a great product and I highly recommend it!,5
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass","The Door Guardian is a great product for keeping little ones inside a home. We have one installed on our front door and it is very effective and easy to use. So how is this different than a standard flip lock, which may cost around 1/4 the price of the Door Guardian?We have several  of these standard locks and will use them when lock certainty is less important. First a standard flip lock uses shorter screws, limiting the security of the attachment to the door jam. Sure you could buy extra screws for the flip lock, but that is an extra step and does costs extra (still nowhere near the Door Guardian cost). Two, the Door Guardian is made with much more robust steel - I can't speak to the steel quality, but the lock has substantially more metal, which I must assume adds to the stability of the device. Third the closure mechanism is more solid. I have found standard flip locks can be rattled out of position is the door has enough play.Beyond security, the Door Guardian offers better aesthetics than a standard flip lock. Also the Door Guardian seems less likely to cause damage to the door that is being locked. Additionally, the Door Guardian can be used with door frames that flare out (where the wood thickness increases as you move away from the door). This is due to the fact that a standard flip lock needs to open to about 270 degrees (or to parallel to the wall - or in the opposite position to closed when mounted). The Door Guardian has an angle built into the device that allows it to sit on these angled frames. If you are confused by this explanation, please Google ""Door Guardian installation instructions"", find a PDF instruction manual, and look at figure 2B. I have been unable to attach a standard flip lock on these types of door frames without damaging the frame (becuase the frame prevents the lock from opening all the way). The last thing I would say about the Door Guardian is that it has a very easy one-handed operation. Standard flip locks are very easy to use as well, but I have found the Door Guardian a little bit easier to operate.Installation requires a 1/8"" inch drill bit for the two larger screws. If your door does not have enough space for the screw plate, which is 1/16"" inch, you may have to chisel off some material from the door frame to recess the screw plate. A short explanation of this: pencil the boarder of the screw plate on the door frame; remove the screw plate and use a chisel and hammer to create a 1/16"" inch groove along the inside of the boarder that you penciled in; chisel in a grid of grooves in the inside of the boarder; and chisel away the interior of the grooved area moving from the boarder groove inward until all the material is gone. The grooves will prevent splintering and removal of excess door frame.",5
Door Flip Lock for Child Safety from PrimeLine - White Color,"I always crack up when you see people in the movies who have those old chain-locks on their doors. Real people don't actually still USE those do they?!? I think they just still put them in movies so the bad guys can break in the door more easily!These brass locks should be on EVERY one of your exterior doors. They're easy and fast to install and you can put them nice and high so your little darlings won't open the door to strangers (in spite of the fact that you've told them NOT to at least a bazillion times!). They're incredibly inexpensive, they'll last forever, they're not a bit unattractive ~ gosh, what more do you want?!? You might have to get a little more creative with a door with a window in it, but, other than that, this goodie is just that. Years ago, they used to make one exactly the same except that it was portable ~ instead of screwing into the doorframe, it had an extended piece of the brass that hooked over the ""stop"" on the doorframe (that's the piece that goes all the way around both sides and the top to stop the door when you close it). You simply took it wherever you went and put it on the door to keep your family safe and sound. (And if anybody ever finds any PLEASE let me know (through here) and I'll be eternally grateful!!!)",5
Door Flip Lock for Child Safety from PrimeLine - White Color,"Buy this simple lock.  Very easy to install, simple to use, and provides safety for children where a door needs to be kept locked, but easy to open when an adult needs to get out.My daughter installed them after she awoke in the middle of the night to find her young child sleep walking and trying to open the front door on a freezing Idaho winter night.  I installed one on the door going down to the basement for another daughter to keep her three-year old from opening the basement door in the night.Simple, cheap, works.",5
Door Flip Lock for Child Safety from PrimeLine - White Color,"Absolutely perfect!! My two year old daughter figured out how to unlock the deadbolt and regular lock on both our front and back doors. I've found her outside twice, even when I've ""locked"" the doors, so I've been looking for a solution with an easy install.  This flip lock installed in less than one minute and works great!  Now I can sleep a little easier, at least until she figures out how to get out the windows...but I'm not looking to borrow trouble!!  I would definitely recommend this product.",5
Door Flip Lock for Child Safety from PrimeLine - White Color,"I installed the safety lock and it works perfectly.  I dont have to worry about my 4 year old or 1 year old son opening the door and taking off or answering when solicitors show up.  Its easy to use once you get used to it. I wouldnt want any other kind of lock for my kids' safety, its great.",5
Door Flip Lock for Child Safety from PrimeLine - White Color,My kids had gotten to the age where they could unlock the regular locks. We installed this and they cant open up the back door anymore. A big relief!,5
Door Flip Lock for Child Safety from PrimeLine - White Color,"These are really pretty nice -- low profile, easy to work, and seem to be pretty strong.  But be careful to note the description: these only work on doors that open inward (i.e., toward you when you go through them).  I was not such a careful reader and they don't work for the doors I wanted to use them on.  My own fault, I realize.",4
Door Flip Lock for Child Safety from PrimeLine - White Color,"It works exactly the way it says it will.4 stars because of three small problems:1 - hinge should be slightly small, so that it doesn't scratch the door2 - it required little practice to lift it and tilt it to open3 - quality of screws supplied with it",4
Door Flip Lock for Child Safety from PrimeLine - White Color,I LOVE this hinge.  I no longer worry about my super active son slipping out.  He can't get escape and this will work for years to come.,5
"Prime-Line Products S 4558 Toilet Lid Safety Lock, White","First of all, I like the fact that it doesn't interfere with the toilet seat not like the other products.  It doesn't look anything very very strong that a big kid or an adult can easily remove, but it serves the purpose of keeping the lid from my 1.5 year old daughter.  Now that she's able to open the door handles easily, I can at least have a piece of mind that she won't be able to open the toilet.  I can put a door handle safety product but then I would have to open the door every time for my other daughter who is learning to go to bathroom by herself.  So it's safe to say that I would prefer to have this than none.  Not the best but it will do.",3
Tiny Love Spin Ball Toy,"This is one of the most beautiful toys my son has. I love the rainbow of colors. The clackety-clack of the outer segments, the colors, and the changing shape of the globe keeps him interested. He'll still look at it now that he's 15 months old. It's also very durable--it shows no signs of wear still.",5
Tiny Love Spin Ball Toy,"My 6 month old niece loves the toy, the mirror in the back always makes her smile and giggle a lot!",4
Tiny Love Spin Ball Toy,The toy is really cool but one of the segments broke within 2 weeks of having it. I have 8 month babies and it is not like they were throwing this toy.,3
Tiny Love Spin Ball Toy,"I purchased this for my son when he was 6 months old (3 months premature) because of the high developmentally benefited reviews.  He began showing interest in it immediately and slowly worked his way up to manipulating it and playing with it with purpose.  His developmental therapist even remarked how developmentally appropriate this toy is.  She wanted to know where to get one to use while doing therapy with her other students.  It is perfect for fine motor skills, raking, pinching etc. He is now 1 and he STILL carries ""click clack"" everywhere.  It is his ""travel toy"".  It is extremely durable.  He drops and throws it and you can't even tell.  He shows intense concentration when manipulating the ""sliders"", rolling the boy faced bell inside, and still attempts to chew and lick it.  It also functions as a rattle.  Another reviewer remarked that ""it doesn't roll"".  It isn't meant to. If you want a rolling ball (your local store has them for a dollar) then this is not for you.  However if you want an educational, highly entertaining, developmentally beneficial, extraordinary toy with purpose and educational value then this is for you.  It washes so easily in hot soapy water and air dries.  When we thought we had lost it, I ordered another one because he liked it so much.  We later found it, and having two makes it even better!  One lives in the car. I cannot stress how perfect this toy has been for my son.  Even the ""high risk"", speech and auditory evaluators prefer to use it in their testing over their own selction of tools/toys.  Everyone always wants to know where it came from and how to get it.",5
Tiny Love Spin Ball Toy,"I brought this one expecting that the ball spin on the floor. It doesn't do that, but my 6 moths boy really love this Rattle. It can be grab very easily, and it is very nice to see. I recommend this as a rattle, not as a toy.",4
Tiny Love Spin Ball Toy,"A more advanced grab and hold toy.  Lots of things to discover such as; colors, textures, shiny mirror interior, safe moving parts that hide the happy face, and a rattle sound.  Just a great toy at a good price.",5
Tiny Love Spin Ball Toy,this was okay -not worth the cost. The baby was not impressed with it. She bopped herself with it on the chin. Very hard plastic.,3
Tiny Love Spin Ball Toy,I love it and so does my 6 month old. This is a great toy. He creeps after it and it keeps him busy for a while,5
Tiny Love Spin Ball Toy,"This is a colorful, noisy, ball with moving parts and a glistening inside.  But...this ball doesn't roll in a straight line, and it is hard, meaning hard on your hands, hard on woodwork it might crash into, just hard to get the hang of how to use it in a playful way. It is called a spin ball, but it doesn't spin either.  ????",1
Tiny Love Spin Ball Toy,My little one loves to play with this. It is smaller than I expected but it was perfect for her little hands and she loved the noise that makes when the sides click-clack together.,5
Tiny Love Spin Ball Toy,"I bought this for my five month old twins.  The love watching it roll.  As it rolls, each piece opens and closes.  It also has mirrors inside as it rolls which is visually stimulating.  The outside of the ball is textured, which is physically stimulating.",5
Tiny Love Spin Ball Toy,This is an interesting toy.... different than I have seen in stores. I bought three for my three grand babies ages 7 months to 11 months. They were interested in playing with it for a while. It was smaller than I expected. A video of the moving side panels would be helpful in understanding what it does before ordering.  I really appreciated the fast shipping.,4

ProudBody Pregnancy Belly Painting Kit,"Takes a bit of patience to apply. You will need lots of coats for full coverage.  But the result is EXCELLENT. Does not rub off easily. I still have it on after a full nights sleep wearing a tank top over it.  Better to use a blot/twist motion with the sponge and then using the brush for details. Use just a tiny bit of water and blot with a paper towel before applying. My hubby painted a sunset on my belly for halloween, and I took 1st place in the costume contest.  I'm VERY IMPRESSED!",5
ProudBody Pregnancy Belly Painting Kit,"The paint looks great, until it dries. It chips and looks horrible. It takes forever to apply as well because the paint doesn't want to stay on the skin.

ProudBody Pregnancy Belly Painting Kit,"Cute product!I bought this kit for my sister's baby shower. (her 3rd shower) Instead of playing the typical shower games, I decided to get her closet friends/family together to paint her belly. The shower was around Easter time so we made her belly an Egg, we all painted something on the Egg. After we were done, she took the kit home so her husband and kids could paint something. It was so much fun, easy to use, and of course, non-toxic.  I would definitely recommend this!",5
ProudBody Pregnancy Belly Painting Kit,"This product allows you to paint colorful designs on your belly.  It certainly does that.  I had my friend, an artist, paint a beautiful Hamsa on my belly.  The colors were initially vivid, especially when applied in multiple coats as instructed.  My skin had no reaction to the paint, and it washed off easily in the shower later on.The paint kit comes with a brush & a sponge, and the following colors: black, white,  blue, pink, orange, red, green, yellow.  The paint is applied with water.  There is plenty of paint to decorate a bevy of  bellies, or to paint yourself multiple times.The downsides, if you want to see them that way, are that the paint doesn't stay on very long.  It is only meant to decorate and bless the belly, photograph the results, and then wash it off.  Over the next few hours, it faded like an old wooden carnival sign.  I think this is an important note for anyone who thought they would paint something and wear it around all day.  This painting kit is not meant for all-day wear.My friend, the artist, also wanted me to note that the brush is not the best quality.  She did a fine job but felt constrained by the materials.  If you want a professional piece of artwork, you may want to get your own brushes.  However, for the average person, it probably doesn't matter all that much.",4
ProudBody Pregnancy Belly Painting Kit,Lots of paint to use several times. Advise: if you have more than one &#34;artists&#34; working on you buy extra paint brushes/sponges!,5
"Baby Self-feeding Bottle Straw - Stainless, 4oz","I love this thing.  My 7 month old was having a difficult time trying to use a sippy cup and she would try to feed herself but couldn't tip the bottle all the way up so this was a great solution.  I can just give her the bottle and she drinks it away.  I know some review complain that it doesn't fit their bottles.

Phil &amp; Ted's Me Too! Hook on High Chair Color: Red,"The Me Too hook-on chair was one of the best baby buys we have made! We just used it for a week in a beach house rental on the cereal bar and it was incredible! So easy to transport, lightweight, just dropped in the sink to clean the big messes. Perfect for the restaurants we visited as well! Much better than those nasty high chairs, plus more compact so servers weren't bumping into our son. Our son (13 months) absolutely loved using this chair!!!",5
Phil &amp; Ted's Me Too! Hook on High Chair Color: Red,"We've had this chair for a few months now and are thinking of getting another one for when we are out.  Our 11mo son loves to sit at the table with us and eat our food/be part of the family.pros- same height at the table, easy to use, good for limited space, compact with easy travel.  Blue (we have this one) and Black don't show dirt as much.  Have yet to find a table it doesn't work on.  We even have a 2"" hang that the chair will attach to without being a problem.cons- if there is a chair underneath it- baby can stand up, so you need to be careful.  Must use the straps or else sits sideways sometimes or stands up.  Red (my friend has) shows stains more.",4
Phil &amp; Ted's Me Too! Hook on High Chair Color: Red,"We initially bought this highchair for a trip but it ended up being so convinient that we are using it every day. Attaching the seat to the table is super easy and takes up a couple of minutes, plus it folds up so compact that you can put it in a diaper bag. Clean up is also super convinient, you can either wash it or wipe it with a wet cloth. I just rinse the whole thing under water (specially after a teething biscuit mess:) and it dries up in no time. My daughter loves to sit on the same level as us and another friend of mine who has an older child says it is the only chair her son can not escape from! The only little flaw with this chair is that if you go to a restaurant with thicker tables, you can not attach the seat (but this is a minor flaw, since it has only happened to us once). We love this product so much that it has become my official baby shower gift.",5
Phil &amp; Ted's Me Too! Hook on High Chair Color: Red,"We love this chair. We originally purchased it for an upcoming vacation, but we've used it everyday since we got it. It's much more compact than the highchair, and my son loves sitting up at the kitchen counter and watching the action. It's very sturdy and easy to use, and it folds up to almost nothing.  It's also very easy to move, we use it on our porch table as well, and it's so much easier than dragging the big highchair around.  I would recommend this chair to anyone with a toddler, or baby who can sit up.",5
Phil &amp; Ted's Me Too! Hook on High Chair Color: Red,"We have 7 (soon to be 8) children and the Me Too chair is the best mealtime chair we've ever owned.  We began with a Peg Perego high chair that took us through our first few children, but it was another piece of furniture entirely.  Large high chairs are always in the way, and we have a large kitchen so it isn't merely a square footage issue.  They are also a pain to clean because of the many nooks and crannies, in addition to the fact that one can't simply drop the high chair into a sink full of soapy water.All high chairs or boosters are work to keep clean, so if you are expecting to be able to wipe one down and walk away, you need to change your expectations.  We have had no problem washing the Me Too in the sink with soapy hot water and then allowing it to dry overnight, but we live in a dry climate.And while the Me Too might not fit every table, it fits the most-used table here- the one in our kitchen.  We can use high chairs provided by restaurants when not at home.I'm off to purchase another for the next little guy arriving in our home soon.",5
Phil &amp; Ted's Me Too! Hook on High Chair Color: Red,"As already the mother of two, I didn't need to buy very much (if anything) when my third child was born, but I am always amazed at some of the new things that are invented from one to the next so I was cruising around the internet looking for new gadgets when I came across this travel-high-chair.  I wish I would have had this for the first two too!  It is so handy, I always just keep in the car and take it in to restaurants or anyplace I want to have a place for my 10 mth old to sit.  Restaurant waiters/waitresses love it too because it takes up so much less space than those bulky slings or wooden high chairs.  This is my #1 recommendation as a shower gift for any mom!",5

Prepare for a lot of comments! Everyone walking by your table will say how cool they think it is and what a great idea.We purchased this item in 2004 and are still using it, now for our second child.

Phil &amp; Ted's Me Too! Hook on High Chair Color: Red,"We have 17 month old triplets and traditional highchairs consumed too much space. We have a solid wood island in our kitchen and these seats attach securely and with ease. They also work well at most restaurants at booths or tables. If you have a more formal table with trim around the under edge of the table, you may not be able to attach these chairs. Assuming your table can support the weight and doesn't have trim, these are a great value and save space. Now all of us can sit around our island for meals.",4
Phil &amp; Ted's Me Too! Hook on High Chair Color: Red,"Our dining area is a small island with two stools. A traditional high chair was too space consuming, not high enough, did not allow our baby to feel like she was eating with us, and frankly, ugly.

They work beautifully together.PROS- small, portable (folds up very small), easily attaches to table/counter- baby gets to eat with us as a family- attractiveCONS- difficult to clean. We use a scrub brush on it after every meal. It is made of a sport nylon that does not detach from the chair for cleaning. The fabric has a texture that is readily filled in by little hands smeared in mashed bananas. We wish there was an easy-to-clean liner for it.- The safety straps design is sorely lacking. It's more of an after thought. They do not fit well and can be easily slipped off the shoulders.",4

Phil &amp; Ted's Me Too! Hook on High Chair Color: Red,"We bought this chair for going out to restaurants and travel.  The size and weight sold us on the product.  When it fits on the table, it works like a charm.  We recently took this chair on a 3 week trip to Europe, because we knew most restaurants in France and Switzerland do not have baby chairs.  The design of many cafe tables were such that the me too chair would not fit.  The edge of the table was slanted and had a thick edge, so it was impossible to screw the chair on tightly.  We spent a lot of time finding cafes where the chair would work, but had to give up at times and feed the babies on our laps, which is never fun.  Also, if a table is light-weight, it can become unbalanced with only one child.I would certainly buy the chair again and recommend it to others ... just make sure it will fit on the tables you want to use it on.  Hopefully, the folks at Phil & Ted's can modify the design to fit on a wider variety of tables.",4
Car Seat Adapters Car Seat: Graco,"I absolutely love my bugaboo frog, but this accessory was so nice for when my son was sleeping in the car once we got to a destination.

Car Seat Adapters Car Seat: Graco,"I was not sure how well it would work with my Graco SnugRide 32 since I read quite a few complaints about how difficult it is to fit a SnugRide 32 onto/off this adapter. I called Bugaboo CS about a newer version of this adapter (that was expected to come out summer 2010 according to the internet) that was suppose to work better with the 32 and he said they don't make it and that though the current version would work with SnugRide 32, it was not user-friendly. But I had gotten my car seat at a great price and really like the print, so I gave it a try anyway, especially after reading the other review about it working with 32.Guess how surprised I was when it took no extra effort to put the car seat onto the adapter and then the whole thing onto the Cameleon, or fix the adapter onto the stroller frame first and then put the car seat onto the adapter. It's just as if you were putting it onto the base in a car. Then I tried taking the whole thing off Cameleon (my first try) which was a little more work. A much easier or probably the right way to do it would be to take the car seat out of the adapter first and then the adapter off the Cameleon.I have not tried with a baby in it since my LO won't be here until April, but I don't think we will have any issue. If I have to complain about something, that would be I probably won't get to use the cute bassinet much now that the car seat adapts so conveniently and perfectly.",5

Car Seat Adapters Car Seat: Graco,"We originally had the Peg Perego Viaggio SIP 30/30 infant seat, so I bought the adapter for the Bugaboo.  The Peg adapter is very different from the Graco adapter.

I had to be on one side while my wife was on the other, as we aligned each post into their slots on the car seat.  It was very difficult and I was completely disappointed in the design.I then found this adapter and since it mimics the car seat base, it was SOOOO much easier to lock the car seat into the Bugaboo.  We ended up returning the Peg car seat (it was too big and way too heavy for us anyway) and bought the Graco Snugride 22.  And let me tell you, it is like night and day.  Placing the car seat onto this adapter is as easy (if not easier) than placing it on its base in the car.As for the price, I don't think it's overpriced, especially compared to the equally-priced Peg adapters, which are nothing more than just the two vertical pieces.  At least the Graco adapter has several other parts, including those extruded aluminum tubes, which justifies its price somewhat.  The Peg Perego adapters should be at least half the price of the Graco.I had no problems assembling this adapter whatsoever.  The pieces fit perfectly.  It may take a little bit of strength to push the rods/tubes into the plastic ends, but I can't imagine anyone having any problems with it at all.",5
Car Seat Adapters Car Seat: Graco,My grandchild wanted to start sitting up in a seat instead of lying down when she went for a walk in the Bugaboo Cameleon stroller. My daughter bought this adapter to use with her Graco car seat and it works great. The adapter is very easy to use and now my grandchild sits in her Graco car seat while out for a walk with this stroller. This ability to easily convert from bassinet to car seat with a simple adapter is very convenient for the Bugaboo Cameleon.,5
Car Seat Adapters Car Seat: Graco,Love this feature. is so great to just carry the car seat around. But I feel like it's so expensive. We only used the infant car seat for 3 months.,4
Bowron BabyCare Shorn Lambskin,"This was amazing until a leaky disposable diaper meant we had to wash it.  We used the recommended Kookaburra Wool Wash and followed the directions.  The individual fibers on the sheepskin clumped together, so that it is rather like someone made a little rug out of many short pieces of yarn, and the skin is now somewhat brittle.  We tried working in lanolin, like you would for a woolie wrap cloth diaper cover, and we tried brushing the fibers with a sheep brush.  Unfortunately though it's now just a shadow of its former glory.  Wish I'd never washed it.",3
Bowron BabyCare Shorn Lambskin,I purchased one of these prior to my son being born last October to be used in his stroller and it has been a great product.  It really does work to insulate in the winter and I have used it all summer in Portland Oregon without a problem even on the hottest days of 90 plus degrees.  I was so satisfied with it last winter that I purchased another one for an area rug to be used primarily for tactile purposed and he really enjoyed it.  I am hoping to find one of similar quality as a mattress pad for his crib this winter as well.  I preferred this version for my stroller because it had better coverage then the one they sell for strollers and I just cut holes where it was necessary.  I should also add that the rug is easy to wash with wool cleaner on delicate cycle and it doesn't shed which is great because my son Christian likes to pull and suck on everything.,5
Bowron BabyCare Shorn Lambskin,"It is as beautiful as pictured, and twice as soft.  All my grandchildren (8 right now, with 2 more coming soon) have spent their first year sleeping on one of these lambskins.  Some have become their ""comfort"" blankets as they grow older.",5
Bowron BabyCare Shorn Lambskin,"High quality sheepskin. My children always had one for everything. Now the doctors say no anything in the bed with baby. However I still got this for my daughter and her newborn as my daughter has fond memories of hers. She even still has pieces of it tucked away in a drawer. She will use this when baby is older. Maybe as a floor play rug, or in the stroller when it is cold. There are many other uses for these. What I do know is it becomes a &#34;lovey&#34; for the child when they are older. This particular sheepskin is amazingly soft, short hair, no smell what so ever and really high quality. I think when this baby is older she will love playing on it.",5

Peg Perego 2006 Pliko Lite Stroller,"I love this stroller.  However, I don't think it sold well in the US because they are onl selling it in Europe in 2007.  Anyhow, I bought this specifically for a trip to the UK.  I worked out great.  Compact fold, light weight, 14 month old was able to take naps.  It did really well with the bumpy roads over there.  I couldn't imagine using a stroller without full shock absorbers on the wheels.",5
Peg Perego 2006 Pliko Lite Stroller,I looked long and hard for a upgraded umbrella stroller and found this one online only. I wanted one that was sturdy enough for a big diaper bag and growing baby but lightweight and compact. It met all of these requirements. Two features i would love to have are a adjustable canopy and handles. When we are walking in direct sun you can't pull the canopy down over him because it is attached at the back. We are also taller and the handles don't adjust so we have to lean down a little bit. I know our 6 month old find it very comfy though with lots of room to grow. The basket is big enough but only accessible from the front. I like that is stands up on its own when collapsed. It doesn't tip over with a diaper bag hanging from the handle and no baby sitting in it. It is a very smooth ride compared to the graco stroller i have. Overall I am very happy with this stroller but feel like I now need another stroller for very sunny days or i need an extra shade.,4
Peg Perego 2006 Aria Twin Stroller,"Pros:very light weightSnack tray""Floating harness""Large basketKids seem comfortableCons:Basket ""broke"" after 7 months of intermittent use (dragged on the ground when nothing was in it)Doesn't really stand alone when folded (very precarious)Front wheels go in 2 different directionsDecals peeled offWe bought this as our mall/errand stroller for our twins when they were 5 months old. It was great for a few months and things started to go wrong. The wheels go in 2 different ways making getting through doors difficult (as it JUST fits through the door), the basket started to drag (and got a hole) even though it has never been overloaded (we hang bags and packages on the handle bar), and the decals just fell off. Yes, it is lightweight, but not worth the headaches that come with it.Now it just sits in the garage. We use our Baby Jogger as our everyday stroller.",3
"Dreambaby Swing Closed Security Gate, White","Are you ever at a party, and wish that you could see adults fumble with a baby gate and look foolish?  Its always hilarious!  Then buy this right now, dont even think about it.  Don't go look in your bank account to see if you have the correct funds, just stack it on top of your growing credit card bill and GET THIS GATE; I cant recommend it enough. Seriously it keeps nonsense OUT: place all unwanted things in your life on one side, you get on the other.  Oooohhhmmmmmm (yoga bear) life is good.  put out the incense! thats so 90s",5
"Dreambaby Swing Closed Security Gate, White",Easy to set-up and use. Very sturdy and worth the money! I would definitely recommend this product. Fits perfectly in a door way. Option to buy extensions.,5

"Dreambaby Swing Closed Security Gate, White","We use them for our dogs to keep them safe, easy to install and easy to walk through!  We have three of them !",5
"Dreambaby Swing Closed Security Gate, White",I bought this gate for my puppies because they kept going in my kids rooms chewing their beds and this really does the job of keeping them out. I had a smaller gate and my Beagle kept jumping it. The gate was easy to put up and is easy for my kids to open it and I love how it closes and locks all by itself because my kids would never do that lol this is a great product and if I have anymore problems of keeping dogs out I will difently buy another one.,5
"Dreambaby Swing Closed Security Gate, White",This gate is great and it was very easy to install (I was a little worried because it looked like it would be a lot harder).  I liked that it could be pressure mounted since we rent and would like to decrease the amount of holes we put into the walls.  The only complaint I have is that the latch seems to stick so it can be a little tricky to open at times.,4
"Dreambaby Swing Closed Security Gate, White","I bought this for my 16 month old baby. They are very easy to mount,nice auto close, Well built. Pretty strong. Buy it. My baby is strong enough and she hangs on to it, kicks it but no use, She could never open. For now, i like it. My stairways are 43"" and i could not find a perfect suitable gate. This one matched my criteria. Perfectly fitted.",5
"Dreambaby Swing Closed Security Gate, White","I think this is a great safety gate, especially for the price.We bought this for the nursery, so we can leave the door open but keep the dogs out of the room. The gate installs really easily -- it took my husband a few minutes max -- and it looks better than some safety gates. The auto-close feature is a good idea for a safety gate, but it would be nice if you could disable it somehow. It does get annoying if I am just running in and out of the nursery and don't want it to close behind me.My biggest complaint, however, is the thumb latch that opens the gate. It's not the easiest to use. You have to slide it back and pull upwards at the same time, which is not impossible, but sometimes it feels 'stuck' and you have to do the motion again. It is not a huge deal, but it does get annoying.Even with those complaints, I still would recommend this gate -- especially if you are going to use it for a room or doorway that you don't go in and out of very often.",4
"Dreambaby Swing Closed Security Gate, White","I have regalo gate and this gate at home. Regalo needs two hands most of the time. This gate is truly single handed. Swings both ways. The opening is bigger than Regalo. Off the two gates I have, I love dreambaby.",5
"Dreambaby Swing Closed Security Gate, White",We just moved to a new house and needed a gate so our older cat wouldn't try to escape out the front door. We bought 2 gates and really like them both.

"Dreambaby Swing Closed Security Gate, White","Or in my case, dog gate. Easy to install, can be permanent or movable, works great, handy one-hand operation with locking, and no cross bars that the dogs (or an enterprising toddler) can climb over! Have 3 of these, planning on at least two more!",5
Phil &amp; Teds Sleeping Bag - Charcoal,"We bought this to use for our infant daughter in our city mini baby jogger.  It fits in there nicely and kept our daughter very warm during out visit in Ohio and Chicago over the winter.

Petunia PickleBottom Tutu Roll- Diaper Bag,"The bag is absolutely beautiful and well made. I love the silk brocade shiney floral pattern. The colors are very soft and elegant. It's very light weight yet sturdy. It's roomy yet not bulky at all. I don't have to bring my own purse any more. If you can't handle it with care, I wouldn't recommend this kind of bag because of its embroidery material. To me it's surely the most girlie and stylish diaper bag. I love ""showing it off"" with my baby!",5
Sababa Toys Fisher-Price Pull-a-Tune Xylophone,"Nothing special.  Many more higher quality instruments out there.  This is okay, but one of the bars is out of tune, which is why we returned the previous plastic xylophone to the store we purchased it from.  Disappointed this one was the same result.  But, we kept it.  Had it for a few years now.  The string is too short to actually play the xylophone with the mallet, so I had to cut it off.  Kids like it fine, but don't play it as much as I thought they would.",3
Sababa Toys Fisher-Price Pull-a-Tune Xylophone,"WARNING: This review was made when the toy was about twenty bucks.  I noticed today that it's listed for more than sixty.  No way is this worth that much.-------------Pros:- plays a nice tune when it's pulled- colorful metal notes- soft edges everywhere- tones are pleasant- seems pretty durable so farCons:- string on the wand is laughably short (so much so that you can't actually use the wand on some of the notes)- metal notes are just a little too narrow because of the plastic knobs holding them in place; forces the player to be pretty accurate in their aim to get a clear tone, and a toddler just isn'tFind a heavy shoelace and lengthen the string by several inches.  If you're worried this would be a strangulation hazard, then plan to either take the wand off entirely, or have a frustrated child whenever the wand jerks short when they try to use it to hit the notes.",4
TOTEaTOT Travel accessory for children,"I am giving this item 3 stars because it did get the job done in that we were able to attach it to my carry-on luggage. Thankfully we also brought a stroller because I would not have been comfortable toteing my daughter in the carseat as I was never able to get it totally secure. The ToteaTot is extremely hard to adjust and must be perfectly adjusted before attaching to luggage. It is cumbersome to reattach at each connection and going through security. We have used it for one two way flight and the mesh pockets on the diaper bag are all ripped up. Despite my complaints, it would have been incredibly difficult to not have had it. I will be in search of something of better quality and design for our next trip.",3
TOTEaTOT Travel accessory for children,"This product was very disappointing.More importantly, it is NOT SAFE/SECURE. The product I received had a snap buckle that would just pop open again when a little tension was applied to the strap. This would have meant the car seat toppling forward, maybe even injuring my child. I had to bend the prongs on the male part of the buckle several times before I was able to get the buckle to stay fastened when pulling on the ends of the strap.  Even though I eventually got it to stay buckled, I wasn't comfortable using it to tote my child, because I wondered if over time the buckle would bend back again and suddenly pop open, or if it had been weakened by my bending it and might just snap.Also, it is not as easy to attach/remove as claimed. Adjusting it correctly takes quite a bit of fussing with the straps, and detaching/reattaching (to go through airport security, for example) is a pain. Just unclipping the straps (which for some reason clip on opposite sides of the luggage, so you can't do both at one time) still leaves you with the straps dangling awkwardly from your bag. You then have to tie them up out of the way so they don't get caught in the x-ray machine or in the wheels of the bag, for example.I also wasn't comfortable with the stress this design puts on the pull-up handle of my rolling carry-on. I have a Samsonite (pretty durable, good quality), but the way the weight of the seat + child pulled on the handle of my carry-on, it felt like the handle might bend or break. If you used this to carry just the car seat itself with no child inside, then it would be okay (but still more trouble than it's worth).Finally:  The straps are thin, much thinner than a seat belt, so the seat tended to move around a bit, even with the straps quite tightly secured and properly adjusted.I returned the product, and came up with a much better solution using just the built-in accessory strap on my rolling carryon (you know, the strap that most carry-ons have that will let you attach a purse, briefcase, or laptop bag). I used that strap for the top, and for the bottom, I used an American Tourister luggage strap (nice and wide, like a seat belt, with very secure buckles), which I got in a package of 2 for $10.",1
TOTEaTOT Travel accessory for children,I bought this for travel by myself with two kids. I had one in a backpack and the 2+ year old in the TOTEaTOT. It works well but you need a certain size handle and a strong suit case. I did not have problems with the buckles opening up though! It worked okay but it can be hard to pull with a 30+ lbs on board. Also a HUGE draw back is that you cannot roll it all the way to your seat as the car seat does not fit down the ail. Something I had not thought of and was crucial to traveling alone.,2
TOTEaTOT Travel accessory for children,"These are definitely something I would recommend if flying with small children! So handy!! Just strap the kids carseats onto the front of your carry-on bag, and poof you have a stroller. Then you take the carseats off and use them on the airplane seat.",5
TOTEaTOT Travel accessory for children,"I tried this and it would not keep my carseat off the ground.  The carseat was too heavy or I could not get it cinched tight enough.  After fiddling with it for 20 mins with my toddler standing and waiting for me, I just dragged my carseat through the airport strapped to the suitcase with everyone staring at me.  No way would I put my kid in it.  Waste of money.",1
"Crumb Chum Lightweight Waterproof Supersize Bib (5-15 months, Blue Hot Air Balloons)",I got the Crumb Chum after my daughter was probably a year old. I wish I had had it when she was a refluxy baby ruining all of her clothes and bibs with spit-up and various other stains. The Crumb Chum covers the whole outfit and keeps her clean from head to toe. It even catches most everything she drops so it doesn't get all over the floor. She can even eat while wearing her church clothes with no worries. She is 3 1/2 now and I still use it occasionally. We are definitely buying a couple for our new baby boy that we're now expecting. I don't think it's hard to wash in the sink. You just rinse it off and then throw it over the dish drainer to dry. It dries super fast too. Great buy for any mom and baby.,5
"Crumb Chum Lightweight Waterproof Supersize Bib (5-15 months, Blue Hot Air Balloons)",I am not one to do laundry and now I have less loads!  My son makes such a mess I can't believe it.

Stokke Xplory Footmuff Color: Red,I like this foot muff purely because of its functionallity.  It keeps my little one nice and toasty when it's cold.What I don't like is that the footmuff pictured is not the one I received.  The pictured footmuff is red with a pattern on the inside.  The one I got was more of an orangy red color with just a beige inside with no pattern.  My husband describes the footmuff as a lobster fisherman color.I love all Stokke products so the only reason this did not get 5 stars is because I got the wrong footmuff.,3
Inflatable Bathtub Alphabet Inflatable Bathtub Liner,"I wasn't sure of this product when I bought, but it is definitely worth the money and has saved my ten month old son from several bumps and bruises (he gets a little rowdy in the tub). The only reason I gave it four stars is because it needs to be cleaned frequently. My son loves playing in the water, so he takes two baths a day and because the liner stays wet almost constantly it needs to be cleaned about once a week. If it isn't, it will grow mold and at that point it is really difficult to clean. Oh, and our tub is slanted in the back and I had no problems with the suction cups sticking to it ( I think one reviewer did).",4
Inflatable Bathtub Alphabet Inflatable Bathtub Liner,Would have been very nice if it had a liner at the bottom with a heat indicator. Also wish the top edges were a little bent to cover tub edges.,3

Inflatable Bathtub Alphabet Inflatable Bathtub Liner,"We love the liner, although it doesn't fit all the way around our tub- my fault I did not think to measure first. Yes, there could be improvements, but I don't think there is any better item of its kind out there, so for now, it is peace of mind. Also, I thought I could inflate it just using my old lungs, but no way....we bought a Coleman low-pressure air pump at Target for 20- and it works like a dream (but a loud one).",5

Inflatable Bathtub Alphabet Inflatable Bathtub Liner,"Don't waste your time with this product. The design in inherently flawed. The buoyancy provided by the water in the tub provides enough force to overcome the suction cups. In addition if your toddler decides to grab it, it may give way and cause your toddler to slip and potentially hit thier head. Amazon should remove this product from their website!",1
Basic Comfort Ultimate Crib Sheet - Flowers,"I have several of these from my older daughter and they make chnging much easier.

Basic Comfort Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover - Lilac,"I'm pleasantly surprised by these covers.  I bought two (lilac and ""sage"") when my baby was born and I've been switching them off since, washing each about once a week for 18 months, and they both look the same as when I bought them: no pilling, the seams have stayed together, the elastic has stayed stretchy, they have not shrunk.  Only one thing, the color ""sage"" is really a mint/lime green.  I'm not complaining because I like the color, but if you're trying to match a baby's room, keep that in mind.**Update**  These have to be the best product I've ever bought for the money.  Seven years and two babies later, I have the same two covers, and they still look like new.  I wash them about once every other week (I have taken to putting a cloth diaper in the high traffic butt-zone and changing that out more often).",5
Basic Comfort Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover - Lilac,Great value for price.  Glad I picked up a few of them.,5
Basic Comfort Lamp Shade &amp; Base - Flowers/Metal,"I bought a few things in the flowers collection from basic comfort. I really like this lamp. It was only $10 and it complements the room without being big and bulky. It will definately be put up on the dresser because the shade does not screw onto the base securely, it just rests on top.

"Sassy Baby 2 Piece Suction Cup Gift Set, Multiple Colors, 894/8369","While it worked, my baby (7 months) loved this toy.  For us the suction worked just fine, but it was sort of moot since he was able to pull it off of the suction base and play with it. Either way, the music and sounds it produced really kept him entertained.Then two weeks later it stopped working.  Not a sound, not a peep.  So I pulled out my screw driver set to see if I could change the battery. Well, the toy uses triangle shaped slots in the screw head, so none of my screw drivers (slot, phillips, hex) work.  So now I can't change the battery and I have a worthless toy (he's bored with it now that it doesn't make sounds).",2

"California Baby Diaper Rash Cream Tube - Calming, 2.9 oz (Pack of 3)","it is useful and comfortable. when baby use this product, he stop to cry instantly. i am thankful for it",5
"California Baby Diaper Rash Cream Tube - Calming, 2.9 oz (Pack of 3)",I love CA baby products but this one makes my daughter howl. It was pretty disappointing considering the price point.......,1
"California Baby Diaper Rash Cream Tube - Calming, 2.9 oz (Pack of 3)","I purchased this product at a store since I've used California Baby products in the past and think that they are ok. The store I was at didn't carry the Weleda brand of diaper cream that I typically use, which is why I branched out and got what I thought was a reasonable substitute. My little guy had not had true diaper rash before using this cream, just a little redness here and there. When I used it, he writhed in pain and howled, which is something he's never done with diaper cream before. That night, he woke up a number of times and couldn't be soothed. I couldn't figure out what was going on. In the morning, everywhere I put the cream was extremely red, shiny, and raw. That day, he had difficulty sitting down. We immediately stopped using the cream and went back to our trusty Weleda, which healed the sore tush in a few days. Totally perplexed, I looked up the California Baby cream on Amazon and was shocked to see that others had a similar experience. It was really horrific to see my son in so much pain. I really can't believe something that is meant to be used on sore areas is so caustic. If you are thinking about using this product, I encourage you to think twice!",1
Avalon Diablo Pitch Stroller,"i really wanted to like this stroller. it's beautiful, taller than maclarens, has a wider seat and just looks so darned cool!first off, let me say this: if you like maclarens (and if you like them, chances are you really LOVE them!) than this may not meet your needs or satisfy your desire for a smooth ride. it does not AT ALL compare, regardless of what the very few UK-based reviews might say. no comparison for true mac users.second i have to say that the first one i received arrived damaged due to a hole in the box that happened during shipping (it had created a burn-like mark on the canopy) and the replacement that amazon sent had a broken canopy clip. it was only then that i realized the clips could break easily on anyone. mine arrived in this condition, though i could see them breaking after normal use because the plastic isn't very durable. i didn't want another replacement so i duct taped the clasp and took a stroll to the library.at first i had been excited because of the one-hand seat recline mechanism, which seemed easier than the maclaren recline but then my son fell asleep on the way home and i realized that both hands (and some muscle) are necessary to recline the seat when the weight of a child is pushing against it. it is not smooth at all and actually woke my son up, so if you have a toddler beware - this may not be an issue for people with small babies. but speaking of the weight of children, the max. capacity for this stroller is 33lbs, again not at all comparable to maclarens but i couldn't find this information anywhere prior to purchase and try calling avalon customer service (they're the distributor's of this product in america). chances are you won't be able to get ahold of them - i had tried, to see if i could get the damaged canopy replaced before amazon sent the replacement. anyhow my son is a large two year old who is already pushing 30lbs and in this stroller, despite it's large size, it was apparent that it wouldn't withstand the weight of a heavier child. i'm sure it's easier to manouever and operate with infants but i wanted this to last us at least a year, though the wheels began to squeak on the way home from the library. sure some WD-40 could fix it, but after just an hour of use? not happy with that at all. i've decided to just return the second one and purchase another maclaren because at least then i'll know i'll be able to push my son around without issues until he hates strollers or weighs 55lbs, whichever comes first.i still give this stroller 2 stars because it does look cool and i believe it has some functionality that makes it worthwhile IF you don't mind using it until your child outgrows it which may be as early as 18 - 24 months. the height and width of the seat makes it appear sturdy and seems inviting for strolling around large and/or heavy children but the chassis and overall design says otherwise. i do like the fact that the boot isn't just a blanket that you attach to the stroller but also has a liner which can be left on for extra padding, by unzipping the boot portion. i think, though, that in the end you get what you pay for. so there are some cool features and a cool design but because it is less than half the cost of similar strollers with similar features, that should say a lot about the product.",2
Taggies Big Soft Blocks,"This is one of those toys you need many off just to have around the game room. They are soft and durable, not loud and will provide fun for all ages...first to explore the cute things on each side...then to stack up around the room.....then to throw at each other without hurting themselves or things around the room. They will provide fun for all ages through out your kid raising experience...we have had them for years.",5
Taggies Big Soft Blocks,"Our child was fascinated with tags, so we bought this and thought we'd hold onto it for a month for her birthday.  Too late, she stopped being so interested in tags.  This toy is great, though, just what she would have liked a month or so before we gave it to her.  It's colorful and sturdy and well made.  We'll pass it on to someone with a younger child.",4
Taggies Big Soft Blocks,"I would have liked to know if these blocks were stack-able, they are somewhat difficult to stack on each other even though the picture seems to do so well.  My son does love that each block has something different two have different rattle sounds, one has an interesting crackling sound and one has a little squeaking button and of course he likes the little taggies.  My son is 10 months, I wish I would have gotten these sooner for him to play with, I still got him some stacking cups which he LOVES to knock over!",4
Taggies Big Soft Blocks,Taggies big soft blocks.  My 6 moonth old Granddaughter loved these blocks (so did my nine year old West Highland White Terrier).  They have little tags everywhere and are very tactile as well as cute animal designs.  They are very well made and will last a long time.  The fun animal designs will be more interesting as baby gets older.,5
Taggies Big Soft Blocks,"I would not buy these soft blocks again.  I love Taggies products, but was very disappointed with these blocks.  I like to thoroughly clean the toys I purchase before my son plays with them.  I tossed these in a pillowcase and threw them in the wash machine.  After that they totally lost their shape and then a couple days later they began to smell musty. If you do buys these, do not wash them.",2
Taggies Big Soft Blocks,I absolutely love this product! My baby girl wont put these blocks down because she enjoys them so much! The taggies on them make for hours of entertainment for her.,5
Taggies Big Soft Blocks,fun for little ones,5
Taggies Big Soft Blocks,"Bought this in hopes to use it at Grandma's, beach, the park and the occasional vacation if there is no crib.So far, my 10 month old takes one nap a day in it; to get her used to it when we really need her to sleep in it.  She really enjoys playtime in it too.  Really glad I picked up the plus size Peapod.  She still has plenty of room to grow into, and the windows have shades for naps.I decided to pick up the Sage Peapod because it was gender neutral and comes with a hand pump for the mattress.  Didn't think I would need the sleeping bag from the red/blue one, and I believe the frame is heavier on the red/blue.  For naps, I place my own cotton sheet inside and she goes in a sleepsack.  The Quicksilver Peapod does not include a pump, and the Peapods with self-inflating mattresses only come in blue Camo or pink.Wished Kidco would provide a self-inflating mattress for the gender neutral tents.It's really easy to setup, minus the few minutes it takes to pump the mattress.  Folds up compactly and easily once you figure it out.",4
Taggies Big Soft Blocks,"I'm an early childhood teacher/nana and know the benefits of block play for children.  It's sometimes hard to find blocks for the youngest of children.  Recently, I became a grandmother, and wanted to buy my grandson his first set of blocks.  (I also bought him his first doll.) I looked at many blocks and chose these. This set of soft blocks is absolutely wonderful. They are bright, soft, easy to handle and visually appealing.  I would recommend these for any baby.",5
Taggies Big Soft Blocks,I purchased these blocks as a Christmas gift for my 8 month old son. They are very cute but my son doesn't seem as interested as I thought he would be! Hopefully he will begin to enjoy them as he gets a bit older.,4
Taggies Big Soft Blocks,"Cute, soft.....6 month old loves them !Much better than than the hard blocks that they can drop on their face when lying down.",5
Taggies Look At Me! Activity Mirror for Baby,"My son had this double sided toy in his crib all the way up until he started using it as a step to climb out of his crib...word to the wise! But for the non-climbing kids, this is a great toy that can either be used as a crib toy or for tummy time on the floor. It has several tags that they can pull on and explore, the mirror is great (reflection isn't too morphed) and the lullaby light up feature on the reverse side was also an unexpected bonus. I definitely plan to use this again for my newborn daughter when she transfers to the crib. Very versatile, cute looking animals and I love that it's gender neutral.",4
Taggies Look At Me! Activity Mirror for Baby,"I highly recommend this toy.  The animals, music, and tags, but especially the mirror are great for many stages of development.",5
Taggies Clickety Twist Toy,"We ordered this for our daughter's first Christmas a year and a half ago, and she STILL enjoys playing with this toy.  The clickety noises, the colorful characters, and the silky taggies keep her entertained.",4
Taggies Stack 'N Nest Cups,Can't stand this toy. My son takes the center ball out and throws it. That is as much action as this toy has seen. It's been in the toy box since we got it 6 months ago. It's adorable but he just doesn't care about it. The fabric the toy is made out of makes me cringe. I have eczema on my hands so I am sensitive to fabrics. This toy's fabric is rough and clings to my skin like velcro. I can't touch it anymore. It's very cheap stuff. The quality of construction is great it's just the fabric that sucks. The little windows that line up and make animals are really cute. I'm sure it would be educational if my son liked it but he's totally in to cars and crashing things together instead of nesting cups and lining up animal faces.,2
"Blueberry Diaper Bag, RED","Got this in Red for a diaper pail liner.  Paired it with a 10 gal flip top trash can and it fits perfect.  We use it to toss cloth diapers and the little ones laundry.

Taggies Grabby Elephant Toy,"This toy is cute.  The little tags are silky and provide a good tactile experience for baby.  It also makes a nice soft musical sound when shaken.  I wish the vibrating piece was easier for babies to pull, but my baby still loves this.",4
Taggies Grabby Elephant Toy,My seven month old grandson loves this toy. It is soft and colorful. His little hands can grasp it easily and he loves the rattle effect. Highly recommend.,5
Taggies Grabby Elephant Toy,I noticed my son sucking on the tags of his bibs and bought this for him. My son loves both his tag toys. I also bought a tag ball. They both keep him occupied.,5
Taggies Grabby Elephant Toy,My 6 months old son got this toy as a Christmas gift.  He loves it!  He likes to play with all the little tags.  The design is great for little hands to grab and hold on to this toy.,5
Taggies Grabby Elephant Toy,"I like it but it's a surface wash only item. Kind of stinks since my baby sucks on it. So, not reusable....disposable.",4
Taggies Grabby Elephant Toy,"I bought this for my daughter when she was a baby, she's four now, and she still carries it everywhere with her and sleeps with it every night. It's REALLY cute!!!!",5
Taggies Grabby Elephant Toy,I purchased this for my 4-month-old grandbaby and he absolutely loves it. Lots of tags to hold and chew on. I would definitely recommend this toy for babies/toddlers.,5
Taggies Grabby Elephant Toy,"A year ago, I bought Taggies for Christmas for my cousin's baby.  She told me that her son loved it.  Once it came time for me to have my daughter, she told me that I should get a Taggies for her too.  I got a Taggies for her.  She is five months old now, and since she was three months old she and Taggies have been BFF.  When I wash Taggies and give him back to her, her eyes light up because she is so happy to have it back.  Taggies keeps her calm, and I even use him as a distraction while trying to get her to eat her cereal, which works.  My husband and I agree that we don't know what we would do without Taggies.",5
Taggies Grabby Elephant Toy,"We purchased this toy in order to have something ""new"" on an airplane trip.  It was a big hit and immeditately became a favorite.  The tags hold my little one's attention--there are so many to choose from, and he loves to eat the elephant's trunk.  He's only six months old but I'm predicting it will stay at the top of the toy chest!",5
Taggies Grabby Elephant Toy,"Loved the elephant.  Exactly as pictured.  I am giving it as a shower gift, so I hope the baby loves it.",5
Taggies Grabby Elephant Toy,My son is 3 months old and smiled the moment I took the Elephant out of the box.  He loves to hold and chew on it.,4
Taggies Grabby Elephant Toy,"Aw this thing is great!  So far it's my favorite baby toy I've received for my little one.  The textures are wonderful and varied, the sounds the toy makes are gentle and lovely and the design is perfect for babies with their grab reflex.  My only regret when it comes to buying Taggies Grabby Elephant is that I only bought one!  I really would love to get more for my friends' babies, because they're awesome.  :)",5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,Much better than a bulky tub. Baby seemed to enjoy too! great for infants!,5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"I have been using this sponge with Ikea's baby bath tub for the past 2 months since we brought our daughter home from the hospital. It has turned out to be a perfect choice. I got an expensive plastic baby bather as a shower gift but it never left the box.My baby complained only the first time she took a bath. Since then she loves it and even when she is fussy stops crying the moment I put her into the water.I was able to give her a bath even when the belly button stump was still there-it didn't get wet.I recommend using a squirt bottle to spray the baby with. I've been using the one I was given in the hospital. Also foaming shampoo is better than the regular one because you will always use less of it, and ultimately baby's skin won't get irritated. I have been using the Mustela newborn-even though it is a little expensive.Finally-you cannot beat the price!I highly recommend this product",5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"This is very good quality and the baby is supported even when it is soaked. I have been laying it on the counter next to our kitchen sink to wash him, but now that he's bigger I think I will start to fill the bathtub a little and put the sponge in the tub. This makes giving him a bath so easy though. I love it!",4
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,Love it so much easier to use than the big tub.. Doesn't take much room.I would recommend hanging in a pant hanger to dry so it doesn't stink like mildew.,5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"Wow, I'm glad I discovered this bath sponge. It's perfect for bathing a newborn in the bathtub without having to wrestle him into a sink and worry about bonking his head on the faucet. My husband is able to safely cradle the baby between his legs while laying the baby on the sponge and the baby seems to feel very secure and relaxed during bath time. This is such a cost effective bathing tool and it dries very quickly, too.",5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,Quality was worth the price! It even works for larger babies over 27 inches. Would recommend this purchase to anyone seriously looking!,5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"It gets the job done. But it is cheaply made. Works great when put in the fisher price, make bath time more enjoyable. That hard plastic in the fisher price tub must be uncomfortable my daughter could not seem to relax while giving her a bath. I got this thinking it would make the little tub more comfortable. It is also warmer than the plastic on the FP tub. Bath time is now enjoyable and she is able to relax.",4
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,I bought it but never used it.First baby? Think about the following:Where would you bath the baby - the most important thing (after safety) is that you don't strain your back!Do you have a place to put this where:- it fits- you can safely wash the baby and drain the water- you can maintain a normal upright postureI didn't :(,4
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,I had this product when my children were babies and loved it then!  You can use a regular bathtub hands free and the babies love being submerged in warm water.,5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,Bathe your squirmy infant with confidence! Comfy for him/her and they stay put.A must have item for parents of newborns.,5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"Just what I ordered!  I had one of these when my kids were babies, and this is just what I was looking for.  It's safe and easy to use for my grandbaby!",5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"This spounge is an amazing value for the price.  It is hearty and holds up wash after wash, it is also soft and cushy and perfect for baby or toddler to lean back on.  A must have!",5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,it was comfy for my son-- but it's bulky and impossible to dry after baths.  so the mold came -- despite my efforts to squeeze and hang it -- in just over a week.  4 or 5 baths and mold was growing inside and out.  disgusting and dangerous!!!,1
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"I received a premium infant ""spa"" bath as a gift which included a cot-like attachment for the newborn phase. However, I still seemed to always have to use 1 hand to hold the head while bathing and because my baby's body was only half submerged I felt he was chilly despite the warm water. I looked into some other brands and nothing seemed too impressive, my Mom told me about these sponge cut-outs she used with us as babies. I found this brand and decided to try it out and it is the PERFECT solution! It craddles the baby and keeps his head in place and out of the water PLUS the sponge absorbes the warm bath water to keep his body warm while I bathe him, it turned bathime from a chore into one of his favorite activities! I use this in the infant tub, but could easily be used in a sink (my bathroom sink is too shallow otherwise this would be my preferred method) or placed in the bathtub. Not only is it an inexpesnive substitute for buying an infant tub but I would actually reccomend this over one.",5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"Our 6-month-old son would scream and scream whenever we bathed him, until we purchased this. Now he just relaxes and enjoys the baths, and bedtime has become much easier as a result. This is easy to use -- it can sit inside his infant bath, or directly in the tub, and works fine in either position. It holds him tightly in place, so we don't have to worry about him slipping around. I'd highly recommend this for anyone who has a child that doesn't like bath time.",5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"During the first week, this sponge was AMAZING. We would put it in the tub to give my son some cushioning until he outgrew it (it is kind of bulky, which is fine if you have an average size baby)but now I use it to put him on after his bath when I dry him off. It's nice and comfy for him.I haven't experienced any kind of mold, and it has gotten completely wet several times. When it tells you to wring it out, WRING IT OUT until your hands feel like they're about to fall off.",5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"I used an infant bath sponge like this one for both of my children and the foster babies we tended.  I have, also, given it as part of a baby gift.  I can't praise the product strongly enough.For new borns, I placed the sponge on the counter top beside the sink.  I, then, had both hands free to bathe the baby.Until a child could sit up, I used the sponge in the bathtub.  I would fill the tub with water to the level of the sponge.  Again the sponge held the baby so I had two hands free to do the bathing.When finished, just wring out the sponge and set it in the corner of the tub.It's lightweight, so it is easy to take if you travel.Once a child could sit up, I had them sit on the sponge and didn't worry about them slipping and possibly hitting their head on the tub.",5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,This bath sponge is a relaxing way to bathe even a newborn (once the cord is ready)! He can lay on his back securely and stay warm in the kitchen sink.  Can't beat the price too.  My only question is whether there are any chemicals in the sponge material.  I prewashed the sponge and used a cloth napkin over it at first but since then have placed him directly on it and see no skin irritation.  I highly recommend this product.,4
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"I have had 7, yes 7, kids and have tried many bath time products.  This is by far my favorite and I've purchased one for each of my kids as they have had kids of their own.  No slipping.  Offers some &#34;hands free&#34; bathing and they love to feel the warm water without just their tushy sitting in the water.  LOVE IT!",5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,There's not much to say about it... it's just nice having a cushy bath sponge for my son's two year old butt to sit on in the bathtub.  Also kept him from sliding around when he was younger and we just stuck with it.  We've gone through about four of them so far.,4
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,This works really well for washing and bathing a newborn infant.  I feel confident lying our baby onto this sponge and it is a much softer surface for him than right into the sink or tub.  I also have it in the bath when co-bathing.  I'm not sure how much longer we will find it useful though (already at 2 months now).  Maybe a couple more months of use?  Then perhaps I will cut it up and use it as normal bath sponges!,4
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"I bought it at Target and promptly threw away my First Years bath tub.  It does mildew, but at $5 each it is cheap enough to throw away every few weeks.  I went through 2 of them in the first 4 months of my baby's life.  I love it.",5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"Perfect solution for my baby during bath time.  I tried to bathe my one month old in the Boon Naked Collapsible tub but she would scream and squirm, sometimes making it impossible for me to bathe her by myself.  Although the bath water was warm, it was winter and I thought she might be getting too cold too quickly.  Using the sponge helped a lot.  Not only did she sit securely in it (no slipping), her crying was greatly reduced to virtually nothing.  I think the sponge held the warm water stay close to her body longer versus my holding her up out of the low level of water in the tub before.  The sponge fits nicely in this tub and dries without falling apart (still using after 4 months).",5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"We were given a hard plastic bathtub as a shower gift, but much prefer using this simple sponge for baths, both in the tub and in our big deep kitchen sink.  Also takes up less storage space.  Even if we need to replace these every few months, I'm glad we finally switched to the sponge.",4
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"I've always used this either for sponge bath or while drying off the baby after the baby and putting on the counter in the kitchen to use! Also I take this if we travel and much easier than brging a big bath! As the baby got older, I again used for the baby to sit on while in a duck bath! Great!",5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,Its getting harder and harder to find these sponges but they are the best. My baby loves it. Only problem is that it collects hair and dust like no other.,4
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,We started using this sponge for our newborn when she still had her umbilical chord attached and could not be fully submerged in water.  Now we use a tub w/ infant sling for our 2 month old to bathe but the sponge is great for having a soft place to dry her off.  We also use it anywhere we need a soft surface to lay her.  We recently took her hand and footprints for her baby book and we used the sponge to lay her on b/c we did not care if we got paint on it.,5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"As a mom of 4, I tried several different tubs for bathing my babies.  This simple sponge has been, by far, the best.  Super cheap yet durable.  I wring it after each bath and hang dry on the line with clothespins.  Works great, no mold. Fits into any tub or sink, great to take traveling.  I buy one for each new child and it lasts well into the first year.  Once they are sitting on their own, it works under the tush as a no-slip mat.  Great product!",5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"I love this bath sponge, and I'm sure my 3 month old does as well! :) I recently purchased the4moms Cleanwater Collectionand was looking for a replacement sponge and was choosing between this andSafety 1st Comfy Bath Cushion, GreenI was leaning towards the frog shaped one because it was cuter, but after checking out both items in store, this one was the much better choice.It's a lot more comfortable for my little one, since it's thicker and squishier.  Kind of like the density of memory foam.  Also the width is perfect since it fits snugly in the tub, which feels a lot safer.The price is great too!  I ordered 3 so I wouldn't forget to change it often.",5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"I bought this because this was highly recommended by friends and family members. I have to start with the fact that YES, it supports newborns very well for baths, so if that's the only factor you are considering about, buy this. But for me? NO, after two uses, I have decided not to use it anymore. The reason is because it is made of sponge, which is:(1) difficult to clean and even more difficult to know if it is clean. Since sponge is permeable, stuff gets trapped. If I try to wash the particles on the surfaces out, sometimes these wonderful particles get pushed beneath the surface and vanishes inside. Can I ever be sure the sponge is clean? Never. Why is this a big problem? Because your baby might decide to poop in the bath, which happened to me. Baby bathing in water mixed, potentially, with their previous poop? Not a good idea.(2) cools down way too quickly. The first time I use it, I heated up the bathroom with a space heater, adjusted the water temperature to ""just right"", made sure the sponge is also warm, and went over to the baby room to get the baby, which took may be 2 minutes, When I am back, the water temperature is still right, but when I put the baby down he cried. Why? The sponge that is above water is now COLD. I don't think there is any way to avoid this besides soaking the sponge under the warm water again before putting the baby in, but it is difficult if you are bathing the baby without any help, and it is something very easy to forget as well.(3) it is difficult to dry. I put it upright after bath for it to drain, just as instructed by the manufacturer, but the bottom part of the sponge will stay wet even after 3 days. Unless I remember to flip the sponge over after a day it will never dry out completely, and this really encourages mold and mildew growth. Not good for the baby.I wish this is made out of a different material but for now, I am bathing the baby in a tub with a swing instead.",1
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"Perfect!  Exactly what I was hoping for!  I put my little Grandson on this in my kitchen sink for a bath and he was comfortable and happy; no slipping around.  When he was smaller he leaned back on it and splashed a little and enjoyed the water.  Now he's a little older (7 months) so he sits up on it and plays with toys.  It's perfect; so easier than a slippery tub/sink, and so much easier that trying to sit on a towel, etc.  I also lay it down dry on my kitchen counter, or anyplace, covered with a towel, and use it for a changing table.",5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"These are difficult to find. This is not terribly long, but by the time baby outgrows it, he shouldn't need it.  I squeeze it out after his bath and hang it over the edge of the tub, and it's always dry by the next morning, so I don't really worry about bacteria growing in it.  Still, we've had a bath sponge for each of our 4 kids, and I throw them away after each kid is finished with it and get a new one for the next baby.  Therefore, I'm grateful this was very affordable :)  I remember reading lots of reviews complaining about how thin it is, but this is actually the thickest of the 4 we've owned.",5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"I'm so glad we bought this, my daughter hated her baby bath tub, but she was too small for the big tub, this worked perfectly. Don't waste your money on more expensive products, this works great and you wont use it for too long anyway.",5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,This is a 4-5 star product.  Makes a potentially slippery bath tub safer and more comfortable for a baby.The EXACT same product is available at Babies R Us for $3.99 not $39.99!!  Four dollars or Forty?!?  You make the call:),1
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"This is a great product to use in the tub when your baby outgrows the baby bathtub. It absorbs the warm water, keeping your baby warm in a shallow tub while washing, easy to rinse, wring out and let hang dry til the next bath.",5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"I got this as a gift for a friend to use with her infant son and it made bathing him a lot easier because it held him in place as she was bathing him. He was a little too small for the little baby bath tubs and this was a great price, it's soft and portable and definitely a great product!",5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"When my baby grew too big to fit in her Puj (which we loved!), I was overwhelmed with the amount of choices for baby tubs. The plastic ones appeared to get good ratings, but they didn't seem like they could be all that comfortable. That's when my mom stepped in and found this gem. She said that back when we were babies, she used them and loved them. Mother knows best. We have used this bath sponge since baby was 2+ months and we're still going strong at 5+ months. Its a win win for everyone.",5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"I received a &#34;bath lounger&#34; as a baby shower gift and thought it was just the cutest little thing - looked like a beach chair for bathing the baby! I had barely laid him on it when he nearly slipped right off. My mother in law told me about the &#34;bath sponge&#34; and I while I stared at her like she had 2 heads, I looked it up, and I'm glad I did. This thing was so perfect while my son was little:Pros: lays flat in the sink/tub; you can let the water warm up while running over it, and since it's a sponge it holds the heat/water so it's comfortable for your little one; wrings dry quickly and easily; CHEAPCons: None. We used this thing for 6 months with no issues.",5
Summer Infant Mother's Touch Remote Control Bouncer,"I got this for my little girl before she was born, and she loved it from the start.  She is almost 5 months old now and still loves to sit and play.  She kicks her feet up under the bunny and teddies to bring them closer to her.  She also just kicks them to get them to raddle.  This is a great buy!!!",5
Summer Infant One Second Ear Thermometer,I bought this but it's junk. My husband and I have both tried it on ourselves and can't get it to register of 95 degrees. That's not going to be very helpful trying to gauge a fever on a little one.,1
Summer Infant Secure-Entry Metal Gate,"Overall, I am happy with the product.  I find that it is a little hard to open at times, but I feel it is very secure and sturdy.",4
Summer Infant Secure-Entry Metal Gate,"The latch takes some practice to get the hang of, but I can do it one handed while carrying a baby.  It seems very sturdy and looks nice.  We've been using it for about 2 months and plan on purchasing one more to replace another baby gate we have.",5
Summer Infant Secure-Entry Metal Gate,"I purchased 3 of these and the first one opened had peeling paint where it had been painted over rust. I was able to return all 3 without difficulty to Amazon.comIt should also be noted that these are permanent installations, meaning you can't remove the gates from the hinges temporarily.  For this reason, I would recommend the KidCo Safeway G20.",2
Summer Infant Secure-Entry Metal Gate,We got this to prevent our two furbabies from accessing the upstairs.  It was pretty easy to install and works great.  I love the fact that it is adjustable and also has a stop to not swing over the stairs.  It may not keep a ""Marly"" contained but my Fox/chi and MinPin are well contained.,5
Summer Infant Secure-Entry Metal Gate,"We purchased two gates, both for our wide stairway. These open and close easily by an adult, especially if one arm is occupied. I do agree with several comments stating that the gates were heavy, which, in my opinion was a positive, since we wanted a sturdy gate, not one that was flimsy. Also, several comments indicated that the screws were useless. I do agree with this statement, since we were not able to use them. They were not long enough, even if they were screwed into a stud. I ended up purchasing toggle bolts for dry wall and 2"" screws when used with studs. With the right screws, I don't think anyone can remove it from the wall.",4
Summer Infant Secure-Entry Metal Gate,"These are great, we mounted them about 5-6 inches from the floor to allow our cat to easily pass under so it's perfect. Sturdy, strong, make sure you mount them correctly.",5
Summer Infant Secure-Entry Metal Gate,"The gate is pretty much as described. I have 2 (one for each end of the stairway) and we have been pretty pleased with them. The latches on this gate will even keep adult visitors off the stairs, but with a little practice it is not too difficult to open the gate with one hand and carry the baby in the other.",4
Discovery 101 - Front Mounted Child Seat,We had a baby seat that sat on the back of our bike but didn't like it because we couldn't keep an eye on our son and all our baby saw was our back. We did a lot of research and found that the Hamax child seat had some of the best reviews and thought we would give it a try. This seat is Awesome!!! We absolutely love it. My husband rides his bike often and likes how easy it is to take the seat off and I like having my child in front of me where I can see him. I can also say that my son likes it better too with the new view. The only negative thing I have to say is that it only fits one of our two bikes. Due to the way the frame is welded on one of our mountain bikes the mounting bracket won't fit. Make sure you look at how the mounting bracket fits in the images to verify that it will fit your bike. For us it was no big deal because we only need it to fit one bike. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.,5
Discovery 101 - Front Mounted Child Seat,This is a great buy that got my son enthralled with biking.  It is easy to install and easy to remove.  A nice advantage of a front mounted seat is you are able to interact with your child as you ride.  I'm 6'5"" and this seat leaves me plenty of leg room.  I installed it on a Specialized Rockhopper.,5
Baby King Bottle Strap ( Each Item Is Sold Indvidually),As a mom of twins I thought that this would help with the bottles that are constantly being thrown from the many ""seats"" my boys use throughout the day.  This one was not worth it.  It doesn't fit all bottles and doesn't fit tippy cups at all.  The strap isn't that long and not adjustable at all.  I found a better one by a company called ""Little BahBee"" get that one instead don't waste your money on this one.,1
Tiny Love Sea Deluxe Fun Mobile,"purchased this item for my 10 week old who doens't really enjoy riding in the car.  i was considering this item or a baby einstein item which was a similar idea.  the baby einstein item wasn't reviewed well so I went with this one.  i was prepared to be let down, but i'm quite pleased.  the music is pretty, i thought it might sound kind crappy since the speaker would have to be so small, but it sounds nice.  the remote works well, you do have to turn the unit on by physically pushing the on button when you put your baby in the car, then you can use the remote to turn it off or back on.  it will play music for 60 minutes, much longer than the baby einstein (both that and problems with the remote were buyer complaints)  the animals don't dangle quite as pictured, they stick off more in a straight line, but it's the same idea.  the lights are bright and red??  they look clear in the picture, i think that would be nicer, i may try to replace them, they're just little LEDs.  all in all a good purchase and it does seem to console my son.",4
"Valco Baby Universal Cup Holder, Black","I use this as a parent cup holder on my Valco Snap. It is sturdy and works great. One word of advice...READ THE INSTRUCTIONS....it is easy to install if you do exactly what the instructions say to do.I sometimes have to tighten it up, but I also tend to hang my keys and small bags at baseball games off the holder....so that is probably my own fault.I definitely recommend no matter what brand stroller you use.",5
"Valco Baby Universal Cup Holder, Black","I was complaining to a friend about that lack of a place to hold a cold beverage when mowing the lawn. She, being the mother of two young children, suggested a VALCO UNIVERAL CUP HOLDER that she uses on her stroller to hold water and juice. I ordered two and with ease attached one of them to my push mower, inserted my beverage of choice, and presto! - problem solved. My neighbor was green with envy when I showed him - but then presented him with the other one as I anticipated he would love the idea as well. I now look forward to mowing the lawn multiple times a week.",5
"Valco Baby Universal Cup Holder, Black",I have an uppababy vista. All the UB cup holders are crap. This one is less expensive and perfect! Easy to install (not sure why people are saying it is difficult to attach). Can attach it to the side or back by push bar. Stays well. Fits nearly any size cup. Got one for my sister's stroller as well.,5
"Valco Baby Universal Cup Holder, Black","This fit nicely on my Bob Revolution stroller. But, the ""cup holder"" I was sent, which looks identical to the one in the photo, has packaging labeling it a ""Universal Drink Bottle Holder"" and has a warning label to not use with hot liquids! Maybe they shouldn't advertise it with a coffee cup in it. It seems like it will work OK but it is not as sturdy as I had expected. It seems a little tricky to get the coffee cup in and out for shorter coffee cups than the one shown in the photo.",3
"Valco Baby Universal Cup Holder, Black","I have an older Peg perego Pliko P3. I lost the cup holder that came with the stroller ages ago. I was looking for a cup holder that can hang off the side since the P3 doesn't have a horizontal handle bar. This cup holder is excellent.It was a little difficult to figure out how to attach it on to the stroller, but once I figured it out it was no problem. It is very sturdy and will not slip even if I have a full drink inside. I like that it can hold a larger cup. I get iced venti coffees all the time and they fit beautifully in this cup holder.",5
"Valco Baby Universal Cup Holder, Black","Fits my Bugaboo Bee...but not perfectly.  If it's not really tight the cup holder tends to spin.  I also wish it was easier to remove the holder using one button instead of having to unscrew it.  (Especially when traveling).  Overall, I'm pretty satisfied.",4
"Valco Baby Universal Cup Holder, Black","This cupholder is perfect for my Maclaren Techno XT. Just slightly have to move it outwards a bit when folding the buggy but apart from that it is great. Very study & holds coffee, cans, bottles, just about anything! Very pleased with it!",5
"Valco Baby Universal Cup Holder, Black","Fits my Baby Jogger City Select perfectly. My stroller has a very thick, square handle bar and it fits with plenty of room to spare.",5
"Valco Baby Universal Cup Holder, Black","I don't have any stroller age kids, but to avoid further loss of coffee mugs off the top of my car I started looking for a cup holder I could attach to my Yakima roof rack. The Lionheart model I used for a year or more required extensive modification, and it wouldn't hold insulated cups unless the handle was open at the bottom, but it once carried a coffee mug safely from Bellevue to Seattle! After it broke I found the Valco, which attached easily and might even fit a square Thule cross bar. It seems a lot tuffer, and some closed handle mugs will fit. Best thing is I'll be the talk of the parking lot at the ski areas!",5
"Valco Baby Universal Cup Holder, Black","I was really disappointed by the cup holder. It's not what I thought it would be. The holder is quite big and we kept on running into it and getting our coats/sweaters caught in it. It's quite stiff, and hard to insert and remove the cups from the holder, which I find quite dangerous when you have a little one sitting in the stroller.",2
"Valco Baby Universal Cup Holder, Black","This product is neither ""universal"" nor a ""cup holder"".  It didn't fit well either of my strollers, so I was afraid to use it.  Disappointed to say the least.  Gonna have to train the little one to carry my hot coffee!  LOL.",1
"Valco Baby Universal Cup Holder, Black",Got this for my father for his gimp cart and he loves it.  I got this because it holds all different sizes of drinks.,5
"Valco Baby Universal Cup Holder, Black","First, let me advise you to FOLLOW MARK TWAIN'S INSTRUCTIONS included in his review! They saved me time and frustration because the package instructions do seem to miss the detail of ""custom bending"" the plastic tab to fit.I bought a couple of different types from Babies R Us to fit on my Graco Trekko jogger stroller (which woefully excluded a cup holder!). This universal cup holder had enough slack to fit around the rubberized grip handles of the stroller, and it's construction is stable enough to assure me this puppy ain't goin' nowhere 'til I want it to! Now that I have it on there snug and secure, I guess I should start jogging soon...",5
"Valco Baby Universal Cup Holder, Black","I have used this cup holder for months on both my Peg Perego and now my Maclaren.  It must be installed as tight as possible in order to hold drinks securely (it shouldn't move at all).  I have placed mine to the side of the stroller and the angle is perfect.  I have never had any spills or mishaps and the stroller folds the same as it would without the cup holder.  Plus, with it mounted on the side, it doesn't get in the way of the seat when it is reclined.  I also use it to hold keys and my phone when it isn't holding a drink.  It's great!",5
"Sevi Mini Pull Along Toy, Cow",we also choose wood toys for our littles. this is nicely made but a bit overpriced for what it is compared to similar toys.,3
"Sevi Mini Pull Along Toy, Cow","This little cow is so cute. We haven't taken it out of the package yet as it was purchased for Christmas, but looks to be well made. It is a little small, but that will make it easier to throw in a bag and take it with us when we travel.",5
"Sevi Mini Pull Along Toy, Cow","I bought this pull toy as a gift for a friend.  It is so cute, but much smaller than I anticipated (I should have carefully read the dimensions).  Before I left the party yesterday, the paint was already scraping off, and the string is not long enough for a toddler to pull easily.  My friend will be attaching an additional string.  However, it is all wood and very adorable.",3
"Sevi Mini Pull Along Toy, Cow","This pull toy is really adorable, the colors are great, the form is great. I like it alot. Can't wait to see our little girl pulling it along side her as she walks.",5
Sevi Le Cirque Rotating Music Box,"The item is surely pricey, but then again, it will serve each of your kids/grand kids 7 times. Most people have bday parties on weekends, and it is not necessarily the actual day the kid was born. We use this toy to make the actual birth day special so the little one wakes up to the sounds of the Happy Birthday song and gets to play with the birthday cake :) it was a big success, and I am looking forward to seeing my son's smile every year as he will hear the music box play just for him.",5
Baby Trend Silverado Sit N' Stand Stroller,"I purchased a Baby Trend Sit n Stand last week.  Already there are features that were immediately annoying.  For one, the seat for the older child does not move.  It doesn't slide forward like some other brands to allow you to get to the basket underneath.  Secondly, the arm rests for the child who is standing or sitting are not cushioned, nor are they at least round for easy holding or comfort.  The parent tray was the best selling point along with the price.  But the parent tray is shallow.  The drink holders are shallow and the compartment and there is no reason for this to be made so cheaply, there is plenty of space to have made it deeper.  I can't even fit my keys in it!  doh.",4
Baby Trend Silverado Sit N' Stand Stroller,"after 2 years, it's still in good condition, kids like it. The only problem is who will be sit in the back? It's me! No it's me! :o)",5
Sevi B My Prince Cross Mobile Toy,"i love, love, love sevi products.  for both of my kids first christmases they received sevi music boxes and i bought this mobile for my daughter who is much more content to lie in her co-sleeper and stare up at things than my son ever was.  you have to give it a little push, but it will move slowly on it's on.  my only complaint is that the wood holder that would have went so nicely with it was poorly recommended, so i purchased the suggested plastic one which honestly isn't great either AND it's plastic. i'm constant adjusting it. :/  maybe do a bit more looking for a better holder.  but the quality of the mobile is fantastic, i love the story of the girl chasing her prince. :)",4
Sevi Fantasy Cubes Toy,"When we received these blocks, my 10 month old son and I loved them.  My son would check out all the blocks, liked to tip the box and make the blocks spill out, and enjoyed knocking them down when I would stack them up.  Unfortunately after about a day, the paint started to chip.  By about a week, most of the blocks had some paint the chipped off.  I was so disappointed that I decided to return them.  Thankfully, Amazon's customer service was wonderful!",3
Kolcraft Lil Sleeper&reg; with Canopy,I love this!  I bought it because we have cats and we wanted them to still be able to sleep with us but not worry about them climbing in with the baby.  I worked great!  The only problem I ran into was there was no sheet with it although it was listed in the parts list.  All I did was email the manufacturer and they sent one to me at no charge!,5
L'ovedbaby 4-in-1 Nursing Shawl Out-on-the-Town Brown,"I didn't want a baby feeder that made me feel like a clown, but once I bought this, I realized how necessary it was. Without a plastic band on the top, I couldn't see my child, who liked to pull away. It made feeding in public very difficult.",2
L'ovedbaby 4-in-1 Nursing Shawl Out-on-the-Town Brown,"I wish I discovered this product when I had my first child, it has made life so much easier.  My second child refuses to take a bottle so I needed a solution for discreet public nursing. This product has helped me turn a difficult situation into a convenience. I carry this ""cover up"" in my diaper bag and I'm free to nurse anywhere in any kind of 2 piece outfit. It offers just enough coverage, it's super light and soft and my baby loves being under it. It doesn't get too hot, even in warm weather. It doubles as a blanket and my daughter likes to hold and snuggle it. Most of all, it's super easy! At feeding time, I slip it on, get myself set, tuck baby undereath and she feeds.  The neckline is large enough so I can peek at her and allows enough light so baby can find her way when latching. So now, I nurse anywhere. I don't have to carry bottles or worry about pumping or mixing formula.  I have this in brown and I get so many compliments on what a cool thing this is. It washes beautifully too--gentle cycle, drip dries fast with no wrinkles.  This is definitely worth the money!",5
L'ovedbaby 4-in-1 Nursing Shawl Out-on-the-Town Brown,"this shawl is way to thick and heavy, it doesn't allow for any air circulation. I recommend the Pirose nursing scarf instead",2
L'ovedbaby 4-in-1 Nursing Shawl Out-on-the-Town Brown,The shawl is a great concept! I agree with a lot of the other reviews as far as the shawl needing sides! My son is a mobile eater...he's always moving his arms and legs. Because of that the shawl never stays where it needs to in order to cover me. Very disappointing! Perhaps if it did have sides he wouldn't be able to expose me all the time. If you have a baby that sits relatively still while nursing then this would be a must have!Love the fabric and design!,4
L'ovedbaby 4-in-1 Nursing Shawl Out-on-the-Town Brown,This item is absolutely perfect since it keeps what needs to be private and yet not causing you to look ridiculous at the same time. The material is really soft which is nice against the babies delicate skin. I would recommend this to any mom getting ready to breast feed!,5
L'ovedbaby 4-in-1 Nursing Shawl Out-on-the-Town Brown,I like it. Only thing I wish was that it covered my sides. It leaves me feeling exposed on the sides. it is really soft and pretty.,3
L'ovedbaby 4-in-1 Nursing Shawl Out-on-the-Town Brown,"I don't think I would feel comfortable nursing in public without this shawl. I use it a lot. And i've also used it as a blanket when I forget to pack one, and as a cover on the carseat or stroller. It covers me well. I was initially concerned about buying it because of the coverage issues mentioned in previous reviews. I am 5' 4"" 140lbs and my baby is very wiggly and I still get coverage. I drape it off the one shoulder on side I am nursing to anchor it and it works well.",5
L'ovedbaby 4-in-1 Nursing Shawl Out-on-the-Town Brown,"Right after we received this nursing shawl we took a very long vacation through many different airlines, and it worked great.",5
L'ovedbaby 4-in-1 Nursing Shawl Out-on-the-Town Brown,"I only used it twice. I didn't get the hang of the shawl, I couldn't see my baby when I was feeding him. my baby ends up pulling it out of place.it makes a great car seat cover but that's about it for me.",2
L'ovedbaby 4-in-1 Nursing Shawl Out-on-the-Town Brown,"AWESOME, EASY TO USE, LIGHT WEIGHT, MODEST TO USE EVEN IN PUBLIC WITH A NURSING TANK! i ORDERED SEVERAL AND I'M GIVING THEM AS GIFTS TO OTHER NEW MOTHERS!",5
L'ovedbaby 4-in-1 Nursing Shawl Out-on-the-Town Brown,"This poncho is large in all the wrong places. The sides are very short, and there's no way to hide yourself without moving the poncho sideways. You cannot see what's going on underneath it because the material is very thin and flimsy and there's no band around the neck part. So holding my baby with the right hand while holding open the collar with the left, isn't very comfortable. especially if you have large breasts.",1
L'ovedbaby 4-in-1 Nursing Shawl Out-on-the-Town Brown,"This cover provides great coverage. It allows me to pull my top either up or down which means I don't have to wear only baby feeding tops. I am considering purchasing another in a different colour so I can colour co-ordinate. Also, it's very discreet. People are usually not aware that I'm feeding the baby (unless they notice his little feet peeping out and then they give me a big smile!!!).",5
L'ovedbaby 4-in-1 Nursing Shawl Out-on-the-Town Brown,"The fabric is nice, i wish maybe the sides came down a little bit longer. Have not used it in public yet, baby does not seem to like being covered up.",4
L'ovedbaby 4-in-1 Nursing Shawl Out-on-the-Town Brown,"I bought this after seeing it on someone and thought it looked adorable. After ordering it and using it myself I was a little disappointed. The material is really soft and comfortable, but the shawl doesn't really do it's job of covering boobs and baby when nursing. The neck is too big and droops down revealing a nursing baby and the sides seem to turn a lot. I like that it covers a lot of the sides, but overall it's not very practical. Other nursing covers seem to work better and unfortunately this one is now just laying in my drawer. I hope to find a use for it this winter.",3
L'ovedbaby 4-in-1 Nursing Shawl Out-on-the-Town Brown,I bought this solely to travel with my newborn on the plane where I knew I was going to have to BF her on take off and landing and wanted maximum coverage and privacy. It worked like a charm. It provides great coverage and it is aesthetically pleasing. I now use it as my primary nursing cover! I've even used it as a blanket for baby.,5
L'ovedbaby 4-in-1 Nursing Shawl Out-on-the-Town Brown,"I tried it out once and didn't like it. I was not able to see my baby to help her latch on despite the large neck opening. And the opening was too large to the point that in some positions I would've felt too exposed if around anyone else. I decided the ribbed neck covers are much better for me. However, if you've somehow mastered the nursing covers without the ribbed neck, then this might be okay. The material is unbelievably soft and it's very attractive.",2
L'ovedbaby 4-in-1 Nursing Shawl Out-on-the-Town Brown,"Although I haven't really used it for ""nursing"" yet because I am still helping my little one master the art of breastfeeding, and the cover does not allow you to see your little one one unless you hold it out, and as I am still assisting him when he is nursing, I need to be able to see.... I HAVE used it as a car seat cover, and it is worth the money for that reason alone! We drape it over the seat and the opening allows you to still use the handle!UPDATE:Now that Kingston is older, I have tried it as a nursing cover, and I definitely like it better than the ones with the stiff neck line. It feels like I'm wearing a shawl as opposed to a stiff, breastfeeding contraption (which is what the other ones feel like to me). Still using it as a car seat cover, and love it for that purpose. We don't go anywhere without it.",5
L'ovedbaby 4-in-1 Nursing Shawl Out-on-the-Town Brown,"This is a really nice nursing shawl - comes with a nice little bag to hold it in, and toss into diaper bag.

L'ovedbaby 4-in-1 Nursing Shawl Out-on-the-Town Brown,"I read reviews about this not covering properly. I have no issues with that. It's not like I'm going to be sitting in the corner of a Starbucks and people will think I'm just relaxing with a latte. It is pretty clear that I'm breastfeeding. Let's face it people, you are attaching a baby to your bare breast. Mistakes will happen. I had no issue with this shawl. It is a nice soft pattern. Covered me and baby just fine. It didn't slip and I could see him. But it was sooooo hot. We live in a warm climate but geeesh.",4
L'ovedbaby 4-in-1 Nursing Shawl Out-on-the-Town Brown,Not at all comfortable to peek at the baby. Very slippery.i struggle to see baby when feeding. I have to createa big opening to see baby and am sure that does not give any privacy,1

Bungee Baby Bouncer,Our 6 month-old baby can't get enough of this bouncer! It is easy to assemble and easy to put baby in and out of it.Great buy!,5
Bungee Baby Bouncer,"I bought this bouncer because I wanted one that would be safe, comfortable, and easy to use for my baby.  This one delivers on all accounts.  The only downsides are that it does not fit wide doorways, and it takes some effort to put baby in it.  By the time I'd get my baby in it and hooked up, she would often be in a bad mood and not last long in it.  I made the mistake, though, of introducing her to the bouncer after she could crawl.  At that point, I think it felt imprisoning to her rather than freeing.  I wish I had given it to her several months earlier (once she could hold her head up steadily).",4
Bungee Baby Bouncer,"I was really interested in the baby bunjee bouncer because I wanted a bouncer that actually made my daughter stand upright, and not just a seat with a large piece of cloth between her legs like most bouncers, to aid in walking. I absolutley LOVE this product. She loves to be in her bouncer for sometimes up to 40 minutes at a time. It keeps her upright the whole time, never any tilting. The only thing that confused me about the bouncer was how to get her in and out because the harness connects to the bunjee in a strange fashion, however, once that was mastered all is well. I would definately recommend this product to my friends.",5
Bungee Baby Bouncer,My son is just 4months old and he LOVES this item.  He looks so proud to be ""walking"" on his own when he's in it.  It's great exercise too!,5
"Dr. Seuss Thing Two Short Sleeve T-Shirt, 12 Months",I think this is great for my daughter with twins.  I wish they came out with all sorts of stuff like this.  Its hard to find boy and girl twins stuff.,5
Baby Jogger City &amp; Q-Series Car Seat Adapter,"We've had the infant carrier adapter bar for the Baby Jogger City Mini for about 4 months now and I have to say it isn't difficult to switch between the carrier bar and using the stroller without.  It's great to be able to let our daughter continue sleeping if you want to run into the store quickly.There are two buttons on each side of the stroller to allow you to connect and disconnect the adapter bar.  As for the stroller's canopy, it folds back out of the way (just like it does for storage) when you attach the infant carrier.All in all, it was a purchase I'd make again.",4
Chicco C6 Stroller Sydney Blue,"I really liked how light weight and durable this stroller is.  The only problem I have with it is that the foot release, to break it down, is a little tough.  I love the color and it reclines back (not a lot) so my son can sleep.",4

Daphne Bath Seat,"I think this is a must for multiples.  I have triplets and these seats were small enough to all fit in our little bathtub at the same time.  There was no risk of them rolling off - very safe.  I used a small dish towel to cover the seat before putting a baby on it...the plastic is hard, which would be my only complaint. Otherwise we thought these seats were perfect!",5

ORE Originals Backpack Diaper Bag Flowers,"I have tried every bag out there, graco,evenflo,jeep,columbia,vera bradley,amy coe, they are either too big or too small or they didn't have a changing pad, and if you go in public you need a changing pad. It even has a little bag for me too. (wallet,keys,phone) because I don't carry a purse this bag is perfect but actually I have the stripe one because I have a boy, but I bought this one for a friend for her baby girl.This bag is awesome, and sometimes it goes on sale, I only paid like 12.00 for it.",5
DaRiMi Kidz Bucket Hat Dark Grey Small,"Love this hat.  It fits nicely/snug, but is still very comfortable for my little guy.  He can swim in it and it dries quickly.  The brim is a good size so that it provides good sun protection but is not cumbersome.  When he grew out of one size, I bought the next size up b/c I loved it so much.",5
ORE Originals Green Peek A Boo Diaper Bag,"I received this diaper bag as gift...thank God! It's cute but, not practical:o( Once you start putting diapers, bottles, change of clothes...the bag is just to thin.

The bag gets misshapen and bulky:o[ The back pack concept is net but, again once you put baby iteams inside it gets to bulky on your back;o( I would say to only buy this bag if you aren't going very far and don't plan to put much inside it. I'm sad because it is a cute bag.",3
DaRiMi Kidz Bucket Hat Orange Small,"This is a great hat for the beach or pool.  Our daughter had another beach hat that was more shallow and had a strap, but it kept getting blow off her head by any gust of wind.

"Sugarbooger Diaper Bag Organizer Pouches, Cotton",Doesn't appear to be waterproof. It's linen type material on the front and a clear mesh material on the back. How would this keep wet or dirty clothes separate? They are completely useless as designed.,1
"Sugarbooger Diaper Bag Organizer Pouches, Cotton","I purchased these bags in hopes to organize my cute bag I wanted to use as a diaper bag.  On the View, Elizabeth talked about how she just threw them in the wash to clean them up.  Well, I did that and my bags are now about half the original size.  The zippers are not functioning very well because of the shrinkage.  I contacted the seller and have yet to hear a response.  This was very disappointng as well since the rating of the seller had been very high.  I would not recommend purchasing these unless you never plan on washing them.",2
"Sugarbooger Diaper Bag Organizer Pouches, Cotton",I love the look and feel of this product. I highly recommend it. I really like how one size is see through so you I can remember exactly what I put in there! Enjoy!,5
"Sugarbooger Diaper Bag Organizer Pouches, Cotton","I bought this set a month before my baby was born. One of the smaller bags tore when I filled it with my babies toiletries. The bags are cute, but they are not durable. Once the bottom tears open you cannot use them again. I was very disappointed that they tore before my baby was even born! Ziploc bags are much better, and they're waterproof! Unlike this set of bags.",1
DaRiMi Kidz All-In-One Short Sleeve Milkshake Pink/Sky Blue 2/3,These suits are great!  I purchased one 2 summers ago a 12-18mo. from another company and my son wore it for 2 summers.  2 summers of chlorine pools and Arizona sun!  It held up great! The other name for it is ""Sunbusters"" I was excited to find this vendor for my sons suit for this summer.  They were very reasonable on the price and shipped very fast!!  I will be looking them again next year for sure!!  Thanks!!,5
Ore Originals Peek A Boo Comb and Brush Set,"We really liked this brush - the bristles are just right, not too hard or too soft. It's also a good size. However, after washing it with warm water just a few times, the coating on it has started to peel - which I think is a hazard for small children. The brush also cracked - I don't know if that's also from washing (like other reviewers have said) or because my toddler has thrown it on the floor a couple of times. Either way, I think it should be of better quality - any item meant for a toddler should be made to last after being thrown.",2
Ore Originals Peek A Boo Comb and Brush Set,"I realize the purpose of the brush bristles is to stimulate hair growth, however the bristles are a bit too rough for my 2 month old. You cannot just use a lighter touch because the hair wont brush through. I love the comb though.",3
Ore Originals Peek A Boo Comb and Brush Set,"If you read the instructions, it says to wash the bristles in water, not the wooden handle.  My brush is not cracked and works nicely.It's not super soft, which makes it work very well to style my baby's hair.  (She doesn't have much at all)  I like to use the comb on my own hair.. hehe.",4
Ore Originals Peek A Boo Comb and Brush Set,"Really like this product.  Great quality.  Made of wood. The brush works well, the comb I do not like.  I have this for my son and have bought for baby gifts several times.",5
DaRiMi Kidz Bucket Hat Orange Medium,"I bought this for my 5yo, since it said kids medium.  It is a baby sized hat. Nowhere in the description does it say for babies.  I was very disappointed in this.  Please update the description.The hat looks good - just not marked well, size-wise.",1
DaRiMi Kidz Rash Shirt Long Sleeve Blue/Light Grey 6-12 Months,"This rash guard is pretty cool.  Only problem is, the neck hole is really small is if it were a wetsuit...which it isn't.  So you really have to yank it over the baby's head.  That's the only reason for the four stars instead of five.  Other than that, it does a great job of keeping the sun off your baby and warming them up a little for longer swims.",4
"The CozyMe Pillow Retro, Nursing And Infant Development Pillow, Royal Swirl","I am buying CozyMe pillows for all of my friends who are new mothers.  It is a great product and the perfect gift at baby showers.  And it comes in so many different patterns, you'll definitely find one to fit your friends' style.",5
"The CozyMe Pillow Retro, Nursing And Infant Development Pillow, Royal Swirl","This is the best gift I received! It's so versatile! I can use it for nursing because it's so flexible. I can adjust the sides to whatever position I am nursing in. Also, my daughter spits up alot less if I use the wedge to recline her after a feeding, and by inverting the wedge, it gives her enough support to sit up and play, rather than laying on her back all the time. The tummy time insert was perfect for her when she was younger, because it gave her enough support to hold her head up.",5
"The CozyMe Pillow Retro, Nursing And Infant Development Pillow, Royal Swirl",I loved this because it was so helpful for nursing.  My baby still loves it at 9 months because she can crawl around on it and lounge in it when she just wants to play quietly with toys.  Great product!,5
DaRiMi Kidz All-In-One Short Sleeve Milkshake Pink/Sky Blue 6-12 Months,I purchased the 6-12 month size for my 2 month old so that we could get two seasons out of the suit.  We went to the Caribean for seven days and stayed in the shade.  She never got a bit of sun.  The suit was comfortable and stains from her diaper washed out quickly with water and soap.,5
Graco Car Seat Travel Bag,"I have used this bag with my infant Graco SafeSeat Step 1, and my (huge) Graco SafeSeat Step 2.I don't know what the right answer is for traveling with a car seat.  This is an okay solution.  I was hoping it'd be a heavy canvas, but it's more of a cheap duffle bag material.  The first time we used it, it got holes in it and the strap popped off while I was carrying it.  It's a battle to get the seat in and out of the bag.  But the carseat got to my destinations and back without damage, so I supposed it accomplished its purposeI don't know what the right solution is, but I hope someone comes up with a product better than this one.",3
Graco Car Seat Travel Bag,"We used this to gate-check a carseat when traveling with our twins (works for both infant carriers and convertible carseats).  My only beef is that the material is somewhat stiff.  I'd like it if it folded/collapsed more easily when not in use, but perhaps that will come as it gets used more.  Otherwise, it's great to have a sturdy bag to put the carseat in, for regular checked baggage or gate-checking.  You never know what kind of abuse it will get put through, and who wants to have their child's carseat ripped, stained, or otherwise trashed?  This keeps it safe and clean.",4
Graco Car Seat Travel Bag,"I bought this travel bag for a recent trip.  The bag is very sturdy and protected my son's car seat while it was checked.  I have no complaints whatsoever with it.  I had initially decided to purchase another one that was more money, but I am glad I didn't!",5
"The CozyMe Pillow, Nursing And Infant Development Pillow, Navy Gingham","Ordered this specifically for tummy time but after recieving I found that it's great for everything else. Having arthritis, using the pillow to rest my child against the wedge or using it as an arm support during feeding time was a big relief. The wedge is great for playtime. This is a great product that is so much more versatile than the competition.",5
Toysmith Busy Zoo Activity Center,"Before purchasing this activity center, I had read some reviews of this item as well as some others.  And the one negative I found for this one is that the paint chips easily- which I have found to be true.  However, It's not something you can't control or fix from time to time and my daughter loves this toy!  She started playing with it at 7 months and in the past couple of months has not tired of playing with it.",5
Toysmith Busy Zoo Activity Center,"After reading the other reviews about peeling paint, I was hesitant to buy this, but gave it a try anyway. Right out of the box I noticed chipped paint and areas that had been touched up with somewhat mismatched dabs of paint.  Globs of glue were noticed around the ""zoo"" structures on top of the box.  I don't think this will look good for long, as it already looks worn and well-loved - even though I've had it less than a week.  I can say that my 9 month old absolutely LOVES it (I know, I know, much younger than the recommended age, but she plays with it supervised).  3rd party sellers are selling this for way too much - you can find it in the store at Target for 49.99.",3
Toysmith Busy Zoo Activity Center,The best toy I've bought for my son. He loves to spin the beads and the abcs. A type of toy that is very versatile with age.I also love that I bought mine on super clearance at Target for $[...]. Still can't believe the price.It was an amazing find.,5
Toysmith Busy Zoo Activity Center,"Our 12 month old adores this toy and I can see how she will grow into many of the features of it. For example, she really enjoys spinning the beads on top but can't push them uphill yet. She also really loves to slam the little wooden doors open and shut (yes, you can slam the door open against the side of the toy. It makes a loud clacking noise that causes her to giggle).I would recommed keeping this toy on a floor or other hard surface. Toddlers can pull the toy onto themselves if it is placed on a soft surface (like in a playpen). It isn't heavy and she didn't get hurt from it but she wasn't really happy about it either. In any case, she resumed playing immediately once both child and toy were moved to the floor. Also, I would suggest padding the edges before giving it to a toddler since it is possible for them to lose their balance and conk their heads against the toy's hard edges. Again, much tears and a little bruise but she was fine afterwards.Despite this, I highly recommed this toy for any but overly protective parents and have added the other Parents busy boxes to my wish list.",5
Toysmith Busy Zoo Activity Center,"This product is exactly what I expected, except perhaps a bit smaller in size than I imagined - but that's not a problem.  It's a fun toy, and my 8 month old daughter LOVED it when she first received it at Christmas.  She played with it quite a bit for a couple of weeks, and enjoyed pulling herself up on it.  She has since seemed to lose interest.  However, when she has playmates visit, it is often very popular with the other babies.  One of the main reasons I bought it is because I can see her ""growing into it"" and using it in different ways over a few years, and I'm confident that this is still the case.  She temporarily has stopped using it, but she'll grow interested in it again, I'm sure.It's a sturdy and very colorful product.  I don't see any danger in terms of loose parts, etc... The only caution I have is that it can tumble when a baby pulls him/herself up on it.  When on hard wood floors, I tend to put a sheet of rubber underneath it.  This protects the floor from scratching, but I also think it minimizes tumbling.  The product never tumbled on my daughter (with the rubber sheet under it) in all of the times that she pulled herself up on it.  But, when we moved it to a different room without the rubber mat, it tumbled on her playmate the first time that he tried to stand from it.  I'm not sure if it was a weight difference, a difference in how they pulled, or if the rubber mat is the key.  Anyhow, with supervision, there was no harm to the baby.I have recommended the product to others, and one Mom insisted on receiving information about the product so that she could buy one for her 8 month old child.",4
Toysmith Busy Zoo Activity Center,A very well made toy with vibrant colors and plenty of activities. I picked it up from a toy recycled shop and it looks like brand new. No peeling of paint anywhere. My 18 month old baby likes it and has all the different activities to keep her busy. I absolutely recommend this toy for toddlers and crawlers.,5
Toysmith Busy Zoo Activity Center,"Purchased for our 17 mos old little girl. At first she appeared totally overwhelmed and was not sure what to do with this thing. But the more she explored, the more she discovered and the greater the fun.It is well built, sturdy and very safe (no sharp corners or removable pieces).",4
Toysmith Busy Zoo Activity Center,"This is the first toy they have that allows play while standing.  They like to stand, using it as support, and use their hands to manipulate all the ""things"" with their hands and fingers.  This big block is loaded with ""things"" to move around with little hands.Mine looks just like the one in the picture.  The paint was fine with no chips or any problems.  The corners have a the edge taken off just like in the pictures.  I can't see how this toy will tip over and fall on them at this age, given their sizes I mean.  It's pretty sturdy.The colors, patterns and symbols all over this toy are probably good for learning many things.  At this point, I don't know if the babies learn from them but it's hard to tell what they learn when they can't talk yet.The downsides are obvious - this toy is relatively expensive (but probably worth it), it is big (but not alll their toys should be small) and it is heavy (you don't want to have to pick it up and move it all the time).I recommend this toy just because it's not like any of the others and the babies liked it right away and used it to support standing while playing.",5
Toysmith Busy Zoo Activity Center,"My 10-month-old son was enamored of his little friend's activity cube. I went on the hunt for one to give him for Christmas (his friend's model is no longer produced), and found this well-reviewed cube, which we happily snapped up from Target for about $[...].The baby loved it, but within one day of playing with it, the bottom brace for one of the little doors that opens and shuts, swung down. Turns out, the hot-glue-and-small-metal-pin construction they use was at fault. It appears that one of the metal pins was missing, causing the brace to swing down, which made the door fall off--including the two, inch-long, sharp metal pins that act like hinges. These two pins were loose on the floor; thank goodness I was right there and saw it happen, or they would have gone right down my son's throat (he was reaching for them as soon as they fell out). That was the end of that. We returned it to Target immediately.When I was researching activity cubes, I wasn't concerned with the toy tipping over--I figure my son is going to fall down quite a lot, and get bumped by things over the years--but these tiny metal pins are truly dangerous and could lead to serious time in the emergency room and hospital.Due to the poor construction of this toy, I can not recommend enough that you look elsewhere for a better-constructed option. I will be contacting the manufacturer about this frightening flaw to their product.",1
Toysmith Busy Zoo Activity Center,"My six month old grandson loves his Busy Zoo Activity Center, but I am very disappointed in the finishing techniques used during the manufacturing process.  I would have expected a toy that was this expensive to have been made more carefully.  I would not recommend allowing an unaccompanied child, particularly a very little one, to play with this toy.Some of the vertical edges of the large cube are sharp and, in several places, rough.  Wood can cut as seriously as a knife blade, so it seems that the manufacturer should have rounded the edges or smoothed them more carefully.  The beads which are on the top of the Center are finished inconsistently; some are very shiney, and others have a matte finish and uneven color.  The differing finishes are mixed on the three wires atop the Center, so it does not appear this was a conscious decision on the manufacturer's part.  Further, most of the beads are nicely rounded, but there are several that are shaped more like olives - again, I do not believe this was a conscious decision.  One of the bridges on top of the Center was not sanded down at all; it is very rough to the touch and could easily splinter.  The animal decals on the mixed-up and match the parts side are already bubbling off; the tops and bottoms of these wood pieces are somewhat rough.  However, as they are end-grain wood, it may not be possible to smooth them as well as one can do with the straight-grain side.One of the more serious problems I saw with this Center was on the side which had three serpentine pathes for different circles to descend.  The manufacturer used plywood on this side and it is splintering off on two of the serpentine paths.  Further, the paint on these paths is chipping away where the plywood has splintered off.My last observation has to do with the spinning alphabet side of the Center.  Each letter has a picture with the name of the object under it.  Many are unusual animals, not frequently associated with teaching the alphabet to a child.  I liked that because it broadens a child's knowledge.  However, the ""u"" animal was a unicorn - the only mythical creature represented; since ""x"" was represented by ""X-Ray"" I think it would have been better of the manufacturer had used a real object, e.g. ukulele, in place of the mythical one.While this could be a wonderful toy for a toddler, I would definitely recommend being very picky about the finish before accepting final delivery on this expensive product.",4
Toysmith Busy Zoo Activity Center,"He loved it when he first got it, but I guess at 16 months they have a short attention span.  He stills plays with it and when he does my son seems to enjoy himself.",4
Toysmith Busy Zoo Activity Center,"I got this for my 8 month old son at Target for a lot cheaper and he loves it!  He stands up with support and this toy is heavy and sturdy enough for him to lean on without it tipping over or moving on carpet.  I also like how the corners have been filed down, so there are no sharp edges.",5
Toysmith Busy Zoo Activity Center,"I bought this toy a few months ago for my son who is now 14 months. He plays quite well with it on his own. He'll play quietly with it for about 30 minutes or so, which is great. It seems to be very well made and safe. While I would recommend this toy to parents, I would caution you to shop around. I bought this toy at Target for about $50. I don't think it is worth the $179.00 it is listed for here.",5
Toysmith Busy Zoo Activity Center,"Our 10 month old daughter loves this toy, she's been playikng with it since we got it at 9 months.  My only complaint is that the paint is peeling off in some areas--one area was clearly damaged and then repainted, without any sanding or proper treatment.  So I have to keep a close eye to make sure she's not getting any in her mouth--I will probably try to repaint those areas myself.",4
Toysmith Busy Zoo Activity Center,"This activity center is beautiful, my son loves it.  However do a quick google search before buying (I paid much less).",5
Toysmith Busy Zoo Activity Center,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this toy!  It's awesome.  I really believe that kids don't need toys that light up and sing.  I agree with the statement, ""The less the toy does, the more the child will do.""  My daughter is 14 months and loves this toy.  However, the toy did have some plastic stuck to the paint, like it was put in packaging before the paint dried, or the packaging melted onto the toy in spots.  I wouldn't give this toy as a gift to anyone outside of my family for that reason.  It looks pretty tacky with the melted plastic stuck to it.  Otherwise, I love this toy.",4
Toysmith Busy Zoo Activity Center,I bought this for my daughter's first birthday and it was a big hit! She loves it.  But I found it for $45 at Target. There is no way anyone should pay more.,4
Toysmith Busy Zoo Activity Center,This is a wonderful product.  My son was 13 months when I bought it for him and he loves it.  My 3 year od niece also loved it when she came to visit.The corners aren't sharp the company did a good job of making sure it didn't have sharp corners.  Also the one side that has the circular blocks that slide down are better than another toy like it that I bought for my son.,5

HABA Lucky Muslin Beetle,This is a nice toy-- it is bright and colorful and makes some noises when shaken. The beetle velcros in place and baby can move him around. I would give 5 stars if this was made out of organic fabric,4

"Luvable Friends 3 Pack Assorted Sippy Cups &amp; Lids, Pink Assorted","Have had these less than three months and just tossed the last one in the garbage due to cracked lid, hence one star. The other star is because they're cheap. But as usual, you get what you pay for. Tupperware tumblers are more expensive but last a lifetime and are therefore a way better value and work better. The only other good thing about these is it's hard to find sippy cups without messy straws or hard to clean stopper mechanisms, so thank you for making a simple product.",2
"Luvable Friends 3 Pack Assorted Sippy Cups &amp; Lids, Pink Assorted",My son loves this.  He doesn't really care much for the fancy sippy cups.  This might not be spill proof but my son uses them.  I got him weaned from the bottle at 13 mos and he's been using this ever since.,5
"Luvable Friends 3 Pack Assorted Sippy Cups &amp; Lids, Pink Assorted","These are great, inexpensive cups for beginners. Good value for the price; my only comment is that they do not last forever.

"Luvable Friends 3 Pack Assorted Sippy Cups &amp; Lids, Pink Assorted",My 10 month old has been fighting the sippy cup transition for 3 months. I tried 3 different brands with the spill proof lids and he wanted NOTHING to do with it. Then we tried a few of the old fashioned cups my MIL still had to see if that would work...and it did!I was so happy when I found these on Amazon. Much cheaper than the Tupperware brand and they work incredibly well. My son picked it up the first time and started drinking from the cup like a pro!I wish more companies would offer a line of simple cups like this. I will be ordering at least one more set for us.,5
"Luvable Friends 3 Pack Assorted Sippy Cups &amp; Lids, Pink Assorted",Bought these cups to allow my 6 month old baby to start drinking from cups. They are perfect for her. She still is learning to hold herself-normally we hold it up for her to drink from the side without the sippy top and they are great.  We've used both with and without the top and either work great.  I want her to learn to not spill without the need for a sippy top but once she is able to hold herself im sure we'll use the top then too.,5
"Luvable Friends 3 Pack Assorted Sippy Cups &amp; Lids, Pink Assorted","This is the best sippy cup I've found, and I've gone through quite a few.  What a waste of money with all the other cups I've been through; for the same amount of $$ I could've gotten these plus change left over!  My baby wasn't able to suck out of all the ""leak proof"" sippy cups (and I've bought at least 3-4 others) but these he'll happily use.  Plus, it's a two for one because you can use it as a regular cup afterwards.  And there are only two parts to wash!One thing you have to beware of though --  DO NOT BOIL these per the instructions!  I did, and it warped the lids so badly there was no way it would fit back onto the cups; so minus one star.  Since they were cheap I just got more.",4
"Luvable Friends 3 Pack Assorted Sippy Cups &amp; Lids, Pink Assorted","The caps stay on well and remind me of the tupperware sippy cups I had as a child, but the straight spout leaks terribly the minute it tips over.",3
"Luvable Friends 3 Pack Assorted Sippy Cups &amp; Lids, Pink Assorted","I was skeptical to order these because they were such a great price. I was afraid they would be cheap quality. They are excellent quality - strong and has a very secure lid. They are just a basic, simple sippy and that's all I wanted for my son. These will definitely last for our second child to use as well.As someone else stated, there is a slight drip the comes out of the spout when it's tipped or on it's side, but it is such a small amount that it's not a big deal to wipe a spot when my son knocks it over. I'm very pleased with these and would recommend them to anyone wanting a basic sippy cup for their child.",5

"Luvable Friends 3 Pack Assorted Sippy Cups &amp; Lids, Pink Assorted","I have been looking for SIMPLE sippy cups for some time now. I was aimed at buying the Tupperware set that my MIL has, but after seeing the price (more than four dollars per cup with lid) I decided to do a search on Amazon. I stumbled upon these and found that other woman too were looking to buy the same expensive Tupperware cups but were pleased when they bought these instead. I too am pleased with these cups; the contain no valves, they are more durable then take and toss cups, the lids snaps on very tight, and they can be put in the microwave (I only put it on 30 seconds to get milk to room temp), and they are BPA free!!!! They do leak out of the spout but that is to be expected when you don't have all the fancy valves... personally I prefer no valves and intend to teach my toddler to be careful with his sippies and not fling them about as he does now with his old cups. But my son is 15 months old and these cups are great as a transition from sippies to cups with no lids. I would not use these cups after just weaning a baby from a bottle because those little ones don't have that type of hand control to avoid spills. The package no longer says to boil them before use (which is a common complaint in the reviews) so I just washed them by hand in hot soapy water. I definitely intend to buy more of these cups because they can grow with my son; remove the lid and they are simple 7 oz drinking cups. The seller Baby Vision was awesome to buy from... they sold the cups way cheap and I received my order a few days before it was expected to arrive. So pleased with this purchase!!!",5

"Luvable Friends 3 Pack Assorted Sippy Cups &amp; Lids, Pink Assorted",I loved these cups when they first arrived.  A great size for my 20 month old daughter and she loves drinking from them.  They were exactly what the doctor ordered - literally since our dentist said we should be using sippy cups with no valve to teach her how to sip.  The problem is that the lids immediately started to crack on the sides.  They fit very snugly and crack when being snapped on.  About half of them have cracked and although all are still usable I am disappointed that they weren't a bit more durable.  I would still recommend this product and possibly even buy more especially since they will also be good drinking cups for my daughter once she learns to drink with no lid - I just wish they hadn't cracked.,4
"Luvable Friends 3 Pack Assorted Sippy Cups &amp; Lids, Pink Assorted","These are cute cups, easy for a toddler to hold, and the colors are pretty.However, the lids were not only hard to get on, they cracked after just a few uses. It was a waste of money.",2

"Luvable Friends 3 Pack Assorted Sippy Cups &amp; Lids, Pink Assorted","Perfect Size, perfect colors.  Easy to clean and easy to use.  I use them for my 2 and 5 year old and have been using them for about a year.  I love how I was able to use them with the top on when my son was 12-24 months and with the top off for my oldest.

They get used daily and have been through the dishwasher many times and still work great.",5
"Luvable Friends 3 Pack Assorted Sippy Cups &amp; Lids, Pink Assorted","I stumbled across these while perusing the much more expensive tupperware brand version of the same thing on amazon.  I remember having the tupperware ones when I was little and I wanted a sippy cup that could double as a regular cup (kinda hard when they screw on).  These snap on very tightly and are great.  Spill proof, no.  It doesn't have all the fancey valves that all the new sippy cups have.  But easy to clean, yes!  You don't have a ton of ""parts""....just a cup and a lid, imagine that!  And the dribbles are really minimal...at least with my 17 month old.  I'm not sure I would have given these to him when he was younger anyway...he liked the silicone soft spouts as a transition from the bottle, these are a nice (and cheap) way of getting him used to a ""real"" sippy cup.

Then I can replace all the baby sippy cups with these easy-to-clean cups.",5
"Luvable Friends 3 Pack Assorted Sippy Cups &amp; Lids, Pink Assorted","These cups are so much better than other sippy.  They are traditional style which is actually better for your child's teeth (ask any dentist) because there is no valve preventing your child from ""sipping"" verses ""sucking"" on the cups with valves.  Yes, it may be messier at first but they have to learn to drink from a cup at some point.  I only wish they were easier to find in stores.",5

Air Transport Sack,This is great to have when flying if you want to keep your Peg Perego from getting destroyed by baggage handlers!!,5
Air Transport Sack,"We bought a new P3 stroller after looking in the secondary market and being dissatisfied with the condition of the used P3 strollers.  Since we are grandparents and won't be using the stroller every day, we wanted to protect it between visits with grandchildren, so we bought the Air Transport Bag.  Keeping the stroller in the bag protects it from dust, dirt, and damage while stored.  The only complaint we have is that even with this light use, one zipper on the bag failed after only a couple of months use.",4
Air Transport Sack,"We have used the bag on every plane trip and it really helps protecting the stroller when you check it at the gate. Also, it hasn't tore or anything. A really good investment. Would have given 5 stars, but one of the zippers tends to get stuck, guess it's from the use.",4
"Luvable Friends Velour Pacifier Holder, Pink",This wasn't what I expected. The string is too short and pulls off too easy. It does clip on easy but doesn't hold the pacifier as well as id like it to.,1
"Pacifier Holder, Blue",Does its job! The sailboats are cute too. Works well with Gerber pacifiers.  Velcro on the ribbon attaches around the pacifier. The clip in the back is made of plastic and it seems durable.,5
"Hypoallergenic Treated Pillow Case Protector - Pack of 12, Queen",The pillow covers do the job. THey are not professionally made but the price was right. My allergies symptoms have improved a great deal since purchasing this product.,4
"Kiddopotamus Faux Sherpa Bootties Medium 6 - 12 Months, Blue Suede",These little pink slippers are too cute!  I bought them for my 8 month old granddaughter for Christmas and she loved them.  I wish they came in larger sizes so she could have a pair when she outgrows these.,5
"Kiddopotamus Faux Sherpa Bootties Medium 6 - 12 Months, Blue Suede",I absolutly LOVE these little shoes. I bought them for my daughter for Christmas and recieved them in the mail today... They are adorable! My only complaint is that who ever packed them into the box had VERY dirty hands. There were brown smudges and finger prints all over them. It is too late to exchange them before Christmas and I am now stuck with a pair of dirty shoes.,4
"Kiddopotamus Roll Brim Hat Faux Suede Small 0 - 6 Months, Blue","I got this hat to match a coat I bought, and they looked great together, I got some gorgeous pictures of my daughter with the set, but the hat does not cover the ears well and it is not a very snug fit (I got size 12-18 and my daughter wore this hat when she was 18 months, not 12, she also is in the 60th percentile in head circumference, so she's not below average).  Definitely would not recommend it as an every day hat for colder climates (seems too winter-looking to be worn in spring or fall there, too), but I guess it can work for the South.  Cute hat, but I probably would not have purchased this hat for a full price had I tried it on in the store.  Maybe on a good sale.",3
"Kiddopotamus Roll Brim Hat Faux Suede Small 0 - 6 Months, Blue",Parents of the baby said that they just love this hat on their little one.,5
"Kiddopotamus Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Fawn Teddie Bears","I needed something easy enough for my toddler who was bopping his head in the carseat. These are soft, comfortable (over the carseat pads) making it extra thicker that help stabilize his head just enough for those short catnaps in the car. They will probably work great alone too for just comfort from the straps to the neck. Easy to put on and take off. Recommend!",5
"Kiddopotamus Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Fawn Teddie Bears",picked these up for my LO to replace the standard ones in the BRITAX carseat.  They are cute but being so plush...I have to place them in front of her chest area...versus over the shoulder.  Works fine but I still have to make sure the straps doesn't scratch her neck when I tighten them before we get on the road.  These are good when she falls asleep...they keep her head more lifted and creates a cushion for her head.,3
"Kiddopotamus Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Fawn Teddie Bears","This strap cover is is well made, good quality and very soft feeling. The bear is not glued on. So I'm quite happy with it. :))) Would recommend to anyone who wants a cute and nice strap covers for babies.",5
"Kiddopotamus Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Fawn Teddie Bears",These are adorable.  They are soft and cushiony. I bought these for a long road trip to Florida and I am NOT disappointed.  They definitely so the job and hold my baby's head up when he is sleeping in the car.,5
"Kiddopotamus Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Fawn Teddie Bears",Our newest carseat did not come with strap covers and they were digging into my child's neck - even on short everyday trips.  These work perfectly and she seems to love them.  The bears also keep her head from completely flapping over when she falls asleep in her carseat.  My order arrived promptly and saved me a trip to our shopping district. I have no complaints with the seller or item.,5
"Kiddopotamus Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Fawn Teddie Bears",I purchased this to protect my daughter's neck from her car seat straps in the summer when she's wearing sleeveless shirts or dresses and it's perfect!  She's much happier without the straps digging into her skin.  They're super easy to put on and off and cute as can be! I highly recommend this product!,5
"Kiddopotamus Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Fawn Teddie Bears","They are very cute and soft, and prevent the belts scratch my baby's neck. I totally recommend these product .",5
"Kiddopotamus Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Fawn Teddie Bears",These are so soft and cushy for my sweet darling's face.  They are great for the cold weather too!  I suggest getting them early on to help for head support as well but my daughter is now 5 months old and I just love them for the comfort and warmth!,5
"Kiddopotamus Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Fawn Teddie Bears","Super soft and cute, haven't washed them yet so not sure how they turn up after washing, but so far love them :)",5
"Kiddopotamus Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Fawn Teddie Bears","These do help support my toddlers head when she falls asleep.  Of course, her head can still flop forward, but they make the flopping less severe and uncomfortable.  They make the straps softer and more comfortable also.",4
"Kiddopotamus Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Fawn Teddie Bears",just love it it is perfect and should keep my lil one safe and comfy and truly supported just love love love it,5
"Kiddopotamus Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Fawn Teddie Bears",Worked well with both our car seats. Helped my sons head stay up and keep him comfortable for hours as he slept on the way to the beach.,5
"Kiddopotamus Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Fawn Teddie Bears","Got these for the straps on my baby's swing because they were just bare belting and rubbing her neck. These turned out to be more bulky than I anticipated and didn't really solve the problem. I'm sure they work for some but my baby has some cheeks on her and these just made her face look squished. Sadly, they didn't work out for us. I found something else at a baby store that worked better.",3
"Kiddopotamus Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Fawn Teddie Bears",These not only look cute but are ultra soft against baby skin. Very easy to wash and washes well. Baby loves to hold it.,5
"Kiddopotamus Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Fawn Teddie Bears","I use it to cover the straps on my daughter's car seat to prevent them from scratching her neck. It also holds her head more upright (it would plop to the side otherwise when she sleeps). Does exactly what it's designed to do, looks adorable, couldn't ask for more.",5
Kiddopotamus Securestrap 2 in 1 Safety Harness,It appears from the image that the child security (buckle??) is in the back but it is velcro. Just how secure can that be with your smart toddler?,2
Kiddopotamus Securestrap 2 in 1 Safety Harness,"ALTHOUGH WE HAD SOME LOOKS AND COMMENTS, MY CHILD WAS SECURE AND SAFE, ESPECIALLY IN CROWDED SITUATIONS, WHICH IS THE ONLY TIME I PUT IT ON HER....ACTUALLY, SHE LIKED IT AND MADE A GAME OUT OF IT!",5
"Kiddopotamus Faux Suede Sherpa Booties Small 0 - 6 Months, Blue","Bought these as a gift.  The material is soft as I would have expected and they appear to be well made. Time will tell how they hold up.  Back to do an update, these were given to my niece for her little boy, she loved them and said she gets complements every time he wears them, which was all this winter.",5
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe 100% Cotton Knit, Large, Blue",This was a life saver for my crazy moving baby boy. I don't know what I would have done without swaddlers for the first 6 months of his life.,5
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe 100% Cotton Knit, Large, Blue","I have used the small and large size of these swaddlers and wouldn't waste my money again. I have to wrap my son so tight for these to work, that I won't be using them anymore.  Too many nights he wakes because his hands escape. It's not worth the disrupted sleep. I liked that these were more affordable than the other ""miracle"" brand, but ended up wasting more money because these didn't work for me. Other swaddling blankets, such as the ""miracle"" blanket do not solely rely on wrapping tight, but also have other tucking aspects that make it effective. If you have a Houdini baby, don't waste your money.",2
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe 100% Cotton Knit, Large, Blue","I think my title explains this product perfectly. My 2 month old has slept 8 hours during the night for the past 3 nights and he's been consistently at 6-7 hours before that. I had a size smaller first and then upgraded to the larger size. He easily sleeps in it in his crib with no issues. Occasionally, he'll pop an arm out, but it's usually b/c I didn't secure the flaps tight enough. GREAT!!!",5
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe 100% Cotton Knit, Large, Blue","My little one loved to be swaddled.  When he stopped fitting in the smaller one, this one worked!",5
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe 100% Cotton Knit, Large, Blue","I bought this swaddle for my son who currently weighs about 16 and a half pounds. He outgrew the one he has had since he was born so I went to the next size up. The stated size is supposed to be for babies 15-22 lbs. He gets out of it constantly and we have to re-wrap him at night which is frustrating and exhausting. I know he will fit in it better soon, but the sizing is off. It also tends to get stretched out after a few nights of use and then needs to be washed and dried to shrink back. There should be an in between size! When my son weighed 14 lbs he was too big for the small/med size and now he is too small for the large.",3
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe 100% Cotton Knit, Large, Blue","My son is 4 1/2 months old and 16 pounds. 65th percentile - he's not huge by any means. We had an ok experience with the smaller size when he was younger, but after the velcro wore out and he no longer fit into them, we ordered two of these with the hope that they would perform the same - just in a larger size!Not so. Gabriel can break out of one of these with the least bit of effort; and, yes, he is dressed in them properly. Even though he is supposed to be within the weight/size limits listed by the company, when the top seam of the SwaddleMe is at his shoulder his hands are already at the bottom seam of the torso portion - nothing like the child pictured.Whether it's his size or the strength of the velcro - that, by the way, isn't really ""Velcro"" at all, it's very thin hook-and-loop - it's very easy for him to work his way out of these. The fact that he is able to do that also poses a strangulation hazard in my eyes, since the hook and loop closure doesn't always come completely undone and the portion that remains fastened slips up around his neck. I have also seen him, while he is wriggling out of the SwaddleMe, raise his arms and bring the fastened fabric up over his face - suffocation, anyone?This SwaddleMe worked for us for about a week. I feel much safer swaddling him using the DUDU method with a very large receiving blanket - if this swaddle comes undone, it just falls away and doesn't pose any type of hazard. (See: [...] or Google search DUDU swaddle)Bottom line: this worked at the beginning. My son still needs the security of swaddling, but is apparently too big or too strong and exceeds the working capacity of the SwaddleMe. If you have a hearty, healthy infant, try something else!",3
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe 100% Cotton Knit, Large, Blue",great product.. and very happy with the seller. Item arrived on time and in great condition. The swaddleMe is the perfect size. Loved how easy it is to use..we no longer use it but highly recommend.,5
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe 100% Cotton Knit, Large, Blue","The large size was big enough to swaddle our 5 month old Grandson and lightweight enough to do so in these hot summer months.  If you have never used one, pay close attention to the diagram about how to use it.  For babies who need that wrapped up security, it is really helpful; and the large size makes it possible to wrap an older baby when the usual receiving blankets become too small.  We are all very happy with this product.",4
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe 100% Cotton Knit, Large, Blue",This product is a must have for newborns!  Baby haven was an awesome seller and I received the product quickly.  Which was good because my baby boy had outgrown the smaller sized one.,5
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe 100% Cotton Knit, Large, Blue",Very nice product. We've got what we needed. The baby sleeps better and don't wake himself up as much during the night.,5
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe 100% Cotton Knit, Large, Pink","It is AMAAAAZING just the greatest thinggg ,,, it's sooo worth it who ever said that it doesn't work they dont know how to use it properly",5
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe 100% Cotton Knit, Large, Pink",item was perfect. very comfy and helped relax and ease baby to sleep. i would recommend buying a size larger because they will outgrow a swaddle REAL fast.,4
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe 100% Cotton Knit, Large, Pink",My daughter had colic really bad and nothing would ever seem to calm her down. We originally thought that she hated being swaddled but we were ready to try anything. We started using these and this coupled with her swing has worked wondering. Truley amazing and even though she's almost four months now we are so not ready to give these up so we had to order them in a large!!,5
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe 100% Cotton Knit, Large, Pink","This blanket made a huge difference in our lives.  We were swaddling our daughter in a regular receiving blanket, but she is such a wiggler that she would be out of it within minutes.  She would then of course startle herself awake.  After a month of getting no more than two hours of sleep in a row, we bought the SwaddleMe out of desperation.  Our daughter now sleeps at least four hours at a time.  She has even slept as long as six hours without waking thanks to this amazing product!  I plan to buy one for every new mom we know!",5
"Kiddopotamus Snuzzler Complete Head and Body Support, Ivory Fleece &amp; Grey Trim",This is not meant for a car seat at all. it pushes the tots head forward way too far for it to be safe.I did however use it in my son's stroller and it worked fantastic! it was my favorite go to piece. in addition I would lay it out flat on the ground and it made a great mat for him to lay on.,3
"Kiddopotamus Snuzzler Complete Head and Body Support, Ivory Fleece &amp; Grey Trim","I wish we had had this for our firstborn, I love this thing! It gives my little girl just the right support so she can sleep in her carseat without the usual head bobbing. It also makes her carseat fit her better, I can actually get the straps 'tight' enough for her tiny little body, I totally recommend this!",5
"Kiddopotamus Snuzzler Complete Head and Body Support, Ivory Fleece &amp; Grey Trim",my baby girl was 10 pounds at birth and did not fix in to this infant body support ...so i gave it to my sister who had a 7pound baby and she fit perfect ...the body support kept her head in place and supported the rest of her body ...the body support is firm but soft very and easy to clean just popit in the washer and dryer,4
"Kiddopotamus Faux Suede Sherpa Booties Large 12 - 18 Months, Pink","I purchased these via the outlet for a to-die-for price. Unfortunately they are sized 12-18 months and a little big yet for my daughter, but I bet she will be wearing these A LOT in a few months time. I'd recommend them to other parents or as a gift.",5
"Summer Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Pink Bunnies","I love these cushion straps, they are the perf3ect size, very cushioned, and adorable, exactly as pictured. A soft pink.",5
"Summer Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Pink Bunnies","i love them, they`re comfy and my baby loves them too, she plays with the little bunnies while giving her the comfort she needs",5
"Summer Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Pink Bunnies","I bought these strap covers:1. because my daughter's neck was being rubbed raw by the straps of her Snugride, and2. because I could get them in PINK and she would no longer be confused for a boy all the time!This product solved both problems.  When I took them out of the packaging and realized how BIG they were I was pretty concerned that my daughter would be uncomfortable even though they are really soft.  Luckily, she adapted easily to them and I think she even likes having them there because she can kind of chew on it and they also hold her head up like a travel pillow when she falls asleep in her carseat.",4
"Summer Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Pink Bunnies","Great product, works great.  Now when my daughter falls asleep in her car seat she has somewhere to rest her head and the straps aren't digging into her neck.  At first she was distracted by the bunnies and would try to eat them, so I turned them upside down so the bunnies are at her shoulders instead of her chest.",4
"Summer Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Pink Bunnies","They are cute of course, but I wanted them to be thick so when she falls asleep its pillow like, and that's whats happening now after getting these. very happy with them.",5
"Summer Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Pink Bunnies","These little pink bunnies are perfect for protecting little necks from car seat straps!  My daughter loves her pink bunnies!  Better yet, they are machine washable!  They are super soft and also prop up a sleepy baby head when they decide to take a nap on a long car ride. Definitely recommend these!",5
"Summer Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Pink Bunnies","I got these to try and improve my baby's car seat experience, they're soft but bulky for an infant.",4
"Summer Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Pink Bunnies","Nice to see, nice to touch, nice to useSome car seats or strollers already come with cushy straps, but I plan to remove the original ones and substitute for these adorable ones. They wash easy, they take long to dry if you don't use the dryer but do well if you use it (in general I do prefer to dry babies stuff open air but it is not always possible...)I am expecting twins boy and girl and it's great to have this in neutral color, so that both have the same: I don'l want to have everything in pink and pale blue!!!Definitely recommend these :)",5
"Summer Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Pink Bunnies","These were exactly what I was looking for.  They held together great while we used them on our ""bucket"" car seat.  They kept the straps off of our daughters neck and gave her a little extra pillow to take a nap on.  We got lots of complements on how cute they are.  We'll use them for our next baby, as long as its a girl, otherwise I'll just order the blue ones!!!  They wash up great in the washing machine too...",5
"Summer Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Pink Bunnies","We Love these!  I bought these because my baby's infant seat had them and when we moved to her convertible rear facing seat her neck was being rubbed without these strap covers.  I was totally surprise when I received them because they are bigger than i thought they would be...BUT my baby LOVES them.  They are VERY VERY soft and cushiony.  They help her neck from hurting so bad if/when she falls asleep in the car.  As for the ""carseat tech"" that said NOT to buy them.....well, all I can say is THEY ARE CLOTH - there is nothing about them that would keep a carseat from performing they way it should...I'm afraid if I did have a wreck without them that my baby neck would be cut by the carseat straps so the straps rub their necks so badly.  =) I sold carseats in a specialty store for years and ALOT of carseat manufacturers include these with your seat! I think you will love them...Audrey does!",5
"Summer Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Pink Bunnies","Very large bunnies, not good for newborns. As my Daughter gets older they will fit well in her carseat, for now i added it to my toddlers seat instead. They are just extremely puffy and overtook half of my newborns head.",5
"Summer Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Pink Bunnies","Came early and looks exactly like the picture, im  very pleased with this purchase cant wait for my newborn baby to use it =3.",5
"Summer Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Pink Bunnies","This is another idea that was long overdue!!  My granddaughter would hold onto these while she was in her seat.  If she fell asleep, these would keep her head from falling to one side.  Wish these were around when my kids were little. You do need these.  A couple different ones would not hurt so if they get dirty, you can clean them.",5
"Summer Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Pink Bunnies",I have several Kiddopotamus products and i love every one of them.  they are practical and give comfort to babies.  this one specifically keeps your baby from getting that red line from the stroller/carrier straps that they'd get on their cheeks or neck especially if they move around a lot.,5
"Summer Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Pink Bunnies",Love this!  Had a set for my 1st child and bought a 2nd set for my baby.  I love that the bunny face holds the babies head in place.  We used this as soon as she was born without the need to buy an infant neck support.,5
"Summer Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Pink Bunnies",Very easy to install on the car seat. Makes the little girl more comfortable with straps covered. And it make my little grandaughter look so cute.,5
"Kiddopotamus Snuzzler Complete Head and Body Support, Ivory Fleece &amp; Pink Trim","I first want to agree with other reviewers in saying that the reason that these are said to be unsafe (padding behind the baby)is not true, there is no padding behind the baby, just a thin layer of cloth.I have read arguments that you should use the support that comes with the car seat because it has been tested for that car seat, and would like to add my experience as an argument against that. I always felt terrible taking my baby anywhere with the ""support"" that came with her car seat, it never failed that she would end up slumped over.  Naturally I worried that this could strain her neck, but I was also concerned for another reason-aren't sling carriers deemed unsafe because some infants can smother due to their chin touching their chest?I found myself praying that I would get stopped at a red lights so that I could make sure she was breathing, an would sometimes stop along the road if she hadn't made a noise in a long time, maybe i was over reacting a little, but I don't think I was.  I knew that I couldn't go on much longer like that so I did some research and found this product.  I absolutely LOVE IT, and would not go without it again.  I love the fact that I no longer have to worry about her slouching, and it supports her entire body and keeps her perfectly snug.  I would absolutely recommend this to anyone.",5
"Kiddopotamus Snuzzler Complete Head and Body Support, Ivory Fleece &amp; Pink Trim","the fabric is soft and cushion, and what's most important it provides good support for my baby. She loves it.",5
"Kiddopotamus Snuzzler Complete Head and Body Support, Ivory Fleece &amp; Pink Trim",You know how babies never seem to fit in their carseat when they're tiny newborns?  The Snuzzler fixes that!  My little girl fit so snuggly in her carseat.  I felt a lot safer knowing that she wouldn't shift around in her carseat.  I will definitely be using this when the next baby arrives.  I buy them for baby shower gifts now!,5
"Kiddopotamus Snuzzler Complete Head and Body Support, Ivory Fleece &amp; Pink Trim",This is a great product.  It supports the baby perfectly in their car seat.  I also like how you can use it in the stroller also.  I definitely recommend this product to anyone.,5
"Kiddopotamus Snuzzler Complete Head and Body Support, Ivory Fleece &amp; Pink Trim",This is SO great!  It is SO much better then those head rests that they give you with the car seat.  Those do nothing but make the baby more uncomfortable!  This truly a must have and a great present.  I am now pregnant with #4 and buying another one.  I wouldn't leave the hospital with my baby without one!,5
"Kiddopotamus Snuzzler Complete Head and Body Support, Ivory Fleece &amp; Pink Trim",Everyone who has a baby needs one of these. My baby's head always flopped over to the side with the little head support that came with the car seat. Once we got the snuzzler she was always nice and comfortable and her head never fell to the side. This is a must have.,5
"Kiddopotamus Snuzzler Complete Head and Body Support, Ivory Fleece &amp; Pink Trim","the support is a little bulky for the car seat. as my infant gets bigger, it is more difficult to get her comfortable in the seat. i feel she is cramped with the support.",3
"Kiddopotamus Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Blue Kitties",I just randomly ordered these for my son's (9mths)stroller b/c I thought they looked comfy. Then I realized they're the same color and plush of his lovey - perfect! He smiles when he sees them. They are super soft and he likes to rub his face on them - nicer than having stroller straps dig into him. Defitely worth it.,5
"Kiddopotamus Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Blue Kitties",This works like it's supposed to and wraps aroundthe straps so my baby doesn't have to have saftey belt marks on his tender neck.  Nice & cushy.,4
"Kiddopotamus Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Blue Kitties","These are very soft and act as little pillows when your baby falls asleep in his/her carseat. Not only that, but they are adorable. I love them.",5
Kiddopotamus Quickchange Portable Changing Pad,"if you are looking for portability this is the product. easy to fold, fits in the diaper bag just fine. yes, its kind of small for home usage, but perfect for trips, going out, etc.",5
Kiddopotamus Quickchange Portable Changing Pad,"It is great; it is waterproof; it is lightweight. I like it, and so my kid. You can use it when you are home or when you are traveling",5
Kiddopotamus Quickchange Portable Changing Pad,"The actual size of the pad is too small to be functional, so I will have to return it.  The dimensions of the pad would only fit a newborn.  The product photo is misleading.",2
Kiddopotamus Quickchange Portable Changing Pad,"I was on the look out for a changing pad to have around the house. I don't always want to go upstairs to the changing station. This is a decent sized changing pad. Nothing exciting, but it does the job and has velcro on it to help it close up after.",5
Kiddopotamus Quickchange Portable Changing Pad,"This portable changing pad is great for travel and for outings around town when you need a clean, waterproof space to change baby. Great feature that it folds in half and then thirds, making it very compact. Wish it was just a little longer and wider but overall a great product.",5
Kiddopotamus Quickchange Portable Changing Pad,I like the conveinence of the gift registry and it arrived safely and promptly and my friend loves it!!Thankyou!!M B-V.(PS-I am speaking about the Kiddopotomus Quickchange Changing Pad-Portable),5
Kiddopotamus Quickchange Portable Changing Pad,"Pros:- pad is made of rubbery material on one side and nylon on the other offering great protection from changing surface- pad is slightly padded which is great improvement over flat hard plastic changing stationsCons:- thick padding (about 1/4 inch) makes it a little bulky in the diaper bag- rubbery material might feel cold or uncomfortable to baby's skin, although it's smoothA little more: I don't undress the baby completely when I use this pad bare in public changing stations. At home I put a burp cloth over the pad if the baby is undressed. A standard pillowcase over the pad also works great (just needs to be narrowed a little).",4
WallCandy Art Candy Factory,"We bought this product for our 1 year old daughter's room. We were looking for something different and are VERY pleased with the quality and appearance. We were able to decorate 2 whole walls with this. We are out of the grass stickers and still have some lollipops, peppermints, and gum drops.The only negatives I have is I wish there was more then 18 feet of grass. Also, the product is a bit pricey but you get what you pay for and it is well worth the money. They peel off easily if you need to reposition them but they stick to the wall enough that our daughter isn't able to take them off. The colors are very bright and look awesome with her light turqoise walls. The company did a great job in getting this to us in a timely manner and even sent a thank you card HANDWRITTEN along with the order. I will definitely order again from them.",5
NameTrain Fire Truck,"This adds another dimension to play as there is only one other fire truck style train that I know of and you can compare the price to this one. Go ahead, open another tab and search it. Okay so you're back? Now you know that the money you'd spend on that could buy 3 of these. The graphics on the side are good looking. The magnets are good enough to pull other trains. My 4 year old is very happy with his fire train.Pros:Made in AmericaCompatible with all styles of interlocking wooden tracksUnpainted portions of train are smooth to the touch, no rough edges anywhereFits under all the tunnels and elevated bridges we haveCons:Most trains have plastic wheels, these are wooden and I worry if they will hold up as long. If they don't, I'll be sure to post it here.Shorter in length than most other trains.",5
NameTrain Fire Truck,"I got this for my grandson for Christmas. He loves the magnetic trains, so I thought this would be a welcomed addition. It arrived in plenty of time and came well packaged.",4
Kettler Kids Dining Chair-Blue,"I love this chair it comes with one piece, no resemblage and such. It's very easy to install and it's inexpensive. The color might not be fancy but I like the quality of it. I'm going to take it with me next weekng on a camping trip.",5
Kettler Kids Dining Chair-Blue,"This dining chair is wonderful.  It's easy to use, portable, comfortable and makes your little angel really feel like they are part of the family.  My son absolutely loves this seat!  We take it with us when we dine out---no more worry about him sitting in a less than sanitary high chair at restaurants.  I have not found a table yet that this seat is not compatible with...and I've used it on a ton of different tables.  If you have room at your dining table, this is ideal.  We have an eat in kitchen with limited space and the standard stand alone highchair was taking up way too much space.  This is perfect!  Can you tell I'm in love with this chair?  Just as a side note, it cleans up quite nicely with simple soap and water.",5
Kettler Kids Dining Chair-Blue,I ordered this chair so my daughter would have something to use at her Grandmas that could be stored easily and saved for later visits.  It worked out pretty well.  The only problem we had was that the snap that holds the back of the chair in place would not stay snapped.  This caused it to just sort of lean against my daughter until we wedged a blanket between her and the very back of the chair.,4
Kettler Kids Dining Chair-Blue,"This chair has been great for my 11 month old son.  It has pretty much replaced his high chair.  He loves it because now he is a ""big boy"" eating at the table with mom and dad.  He is still a little short for it, so we put kitchen towels underneath him to raise him up to a better level with the table top.  It is very secure, easy to use, lightweight, and excellent for traveling.  The only small complaint I have is that the back of the chair sometimes comes unsnapped and gets in the way when I put my son in it. The manufacturer should have made the snap stronger or designed it differently.  The chair also gets really messy, but it is machine washable (My mom has a dining chair that is plastic and easier to clean, but not as lightweight).  Overall, it is a great purchase at a great price.",4
Kettler Kids Universal Pad-Red,"I was going to sew a new head/seat pad for my vintage (70's) highchair.  Since my grand-children would be using it, I wanted to be very particular with it.  When I saw this item I thought instead of sewing I'd give this a try. I am very pleased with this head/seat pad.  It fits my highchair very nicely, and I think it would probably fit most any of the new chairs and portable seats as well.",5
Kettler Kids Toy Chest/Bench-Mahogany,... if it wasn't missing the back slat for the bench part ... still trying to get that part ... may have to return the whole thing ... shipping will be expensive as it is heavy.,3
Kettler Kids Toy Chest/Bench-Mahogany,Good toy chest seems nice after I had to fix a part that came broken.,3
Kettler Kids Bouncer-Beige,We got this bouncer as a gift from my uncle and aunt. Our baby loves to play in this bouncer and even sleeps in it. The slant position is perfect for her specially soon after feedings. We simply love this item.,5
Disney Tote 'n Go Plus Play Yard,"Great portable crib.  Goes together easily, and folds up easily.  Made well, and nice looking at the same time.  Love the fact that you can roll it. Can't wait for our grandchildren to be sleeping peacefully in it.",4
Disney Tote 'n Go Plus Play Yard,"Setup and take down on this are easy and quick. It's sturdy and nicely cushioned. It's a simple device with an obviously important function. While still new, it seems safe, comfortable, easily portable, and durable.",5
Cloud b LullaBag Fleece - Baby Sleep Bag - Small Pink (1-6 months),"We live in MN, and it is very cold here in the winter.  I dress my baby in a long sleeved onsie, fleece Pj's and then put her in the fleece lullabag and she stays warm all night.  I have never worried about the lullabag covering her face like I would with a blanket. It is important to remember to purchase the fleece lullabag for cool/cold climates and the cotton lullabag for warmer climates. Night time Diaper changes are super easy as there is zipper access at the bottom of the bag. This product also helped with bedtime routine as just the feel/smell of it helped her to know it is bed time.  I HIGHLY recommend this product.",5
Cloud b LullaBag Fleece - Baby Sleep Bag - Small Pink (1-6 months),"The fleece is very thick. Also, it unzips from the top. I prefer the Halo Sleepsack which unzips from the bottom for easier diaper changes.",3
Cloud b LullaWrap Flannel Swaddling Blanket Blue,We got this swaddling blanket because of the reviews (and it cost less at the time than the $21). I think I used it only two times because it is just too warm and gives the same swaddle as do our normal receiving blankets. Of course it does have the little hood which is a nice feature. But as I said in the the title: It is too hot for us and we will probably give it away or use it as a normal blanket. We got the (inexpensive) SWADDLEME as a gift a little later and we love it. She does not always accept it but when she does (when she is really excited or upset) it immediately puts her to rest and often to sleep and she sleeps longer in it.,4
Cloud b LullaWrap Flannel Swaddling Blanket Blue,"Purchased this to send to day care because we were swaddling at home but didn't want to send my SwaddleMe's to school every day. I will swear up and down by the SwaddleMe's and cried the day he finally grew out of them...but he LOVES this blanket.  Not only did it take longer for him to outgrow this blanket as a swaddler, but he also continues to use it as his blanket now that he's in the ""big boy"" class.  In addition, this is a wonderful company to work with.",5
Cloud b LullaWrap Flannel Swaddling Blanket Blue,"You will not find a better swaddling blanket!  It is made of fantastically soft flannel and is the perfect size and shape to swaddle your little one in the first months to keep him warm and secure.  All the colors it comes in are also tender and whispery.I have tried many different swaddling blankets with my first child and never found the perfect one, he always seemed to wiggle his way out of each and every one.  When I was pregnant with my second, I have found the LullaWrap and, impressed by its description, purchased four.  I have never regretted buying it, in fact, I was amazed and delighted with both the quality and the design of it every time I used it.Stock up a bit on these, as babies frequently have accidents and you'll want a few clean ones before you get a chance to wash them.",5
Cloud b LullaBag Fleece - Baby Sleep Bag - Small Blue (1-6 months),This is a MUST have for any baby! No need to worry about babies with the blankets over their face. This wearable blanket stays right in place and keeps baby warm all night! Perfect for newborns and they sell bigger sizes perfect for toddlers. This is our favorite baby item! I give it to everyone I know having a baby!,5
Cloud b Baby Turtle with Quiet Rattle,"Based on the picture, I thought it would be a little bigger but it's actually a great size and very cute!",5
Cloud b Baby Turtle with Quiet Rattle,Anyone who wants a cute rattle for their baby should get this. My daughter loves to hold and shake this rattle and getting to see her happy little smile while she does this is a huge plus.,5
Cloud b Baby Turtle with Quiet Rattle,"Too big for my 4 month old to really get a good hold, but it is really cute and soft.",3
Cloud b Baby Turtle with Quiet Rattle,"This rattle is adorable! It's the perfect size for tiny hands, and although my baby hasn't reached the age where he can actually hold things yet, he likes to hug it to his chest and he likes looking at it when I make it rattle. Aside from it being a rattle, it's really well made and is just too stinkin' cute! We collect turtles, so this is a baby toy that will probably remain out with our collection instead of getting packed up once the baby outgrows it.",5
Cloud b Baby Turtle with Quiet Rattle,"This is adorable, but is very tiny and the colors are darker and more drab than they appear in the picture.  The rattle sound is pleasant and soft sounding and overall it's a very nice little turtle, with an emphasis on little!  I gave it 4 stars only because it's quite small for the price which would be more reasonable at $5-$6.",4
Cloud b Baby Turtle with Quiet Rattle,My 1.5 yr old toddler still snuggles with this lol the colors are soothing and the turtle is so soft,5
Cloud b Baby Turtle with Quiet Rattle,"My grandson has a turtle themed room and when I saw this I had to get it.  It is so soft and rattles gently.  He loves it!  Small enough to hold in his hands, made well enough to handle his chewing and sucking on it, and when his arms get flying it doesn't hurt when he hits himself.",5
Cloud b Baby Turtle with Quiet Rattle,"We're trying to fix up my one-year-old's sleep.  She didn't have a lovey, and we needed to ditch her pacifier.  She loves, loves, loves her Twilight Turtle (""turtle"" and ""star"" were among her first words thanks to that), so I decided to get some more ""huggable"" turtles to use as loveys.  I got this rattle one, a small keychain turtle, and a larger pillow turtle (all Cloud b products in the Twilight Turtle family).  Well, the pillow was too big for a lovey, the keychain turtle too small, and while this guy was a little smaller than I would have liked, it still makes a great lovey.  It's soft, she can shake it and the sound can comfort her in the dark when she can't see, and it's just big enough that it doesn't immediately fall through the crib bars.  Wish it were just a little larger, but for the price you won't hear me complain.",4
Cloud b LullaBag Fleece - Baby Sleep Bag-Small Sage (1-6 months),"I loved this sleep sack when we first got it, but the velcro tab at the top stopped sticking. It now is constantly in my daughter's face, as well as the metal zipper. I prefer the halo microfleece sleep sack to this.",3
Cloud b LullaBag Fleece - Baby Sleep Bag-Small Sage (1-6 months),"I loved this sleep sack and I ordered it specially because it had giraffes on it, but I received one with duckies instead.  Still a great product.  Very long for extended use, but miss the giraffes.",3
Cloud b Baby Lavender Lab with 3 Spill Cloths - Natural,I really like this item as a gift.  The cloths are very soft and work very well.  They clean up easily.  They are very well made.  The price is good if you look at other organic cloths.  The presentation is really nice.  The little soft animals are very well made and smell very nice.,5
Cloud b LullaBag Fleece - Baby Sleep Bag - Large Pink (6-18 months),"I use this product with my two babies and its very comfortable, avoids getting cold at night and loosin banket cover.",5
MOBI Floating Waterproof Digital Bath Thermometer w/ Alarm,I give it one star because i am not the first one to mention this; after one month ts started showing temperature 5 degrees above the actual water temperature. For the sake of other buyer i hope this thing only errors one way (showing water hotter than actual instead of colder than actual).,1
MOBI Floating Waterproof Digital Bath Thermometer w/ Alarm,I bought this thermometer for the safety of my first child.  I am glad that I did because it is quite useful.  It has a large digital display of the temperature.  It also warns both audibly and digitally that the bath is too hot (great for Grandma's who cannot read the display.)  I would recommend this product for all parents and grandparents!,5
MOBI Floating Waterproof Digital Bath Thermometer w/ Alarm,"I bought this product online when my son was just born and it has lasted 5 years. I have used it for every one of his baths. It has certainly been a great product and I recommend it or something similar to check you child's bath water. Our water runs hot and it has saved my son from getting burned.  It has been great having it. Now I have to find another one. Everyone seems to be sold out, so that should tell you something about the product!",5
MOBI Portable Rechargeable Light Orange,"It's a cute little night lite but it is LITTLE, only about 4.5 inches tall. It has a power adapter that plugs into the back of the light. I thought it sat on a base and lite when you took it off the base, but you have to unplug it in the back, then anchor the cord so it doesn't slide off the table and get lost when you unplug it. It has a button on the bottom that you push for on dim setting, then push again for brighter, then push a third time for bright with a 15 minute timer that dims to off and if you push it a forth time it goes off. For best use it recommends letting it die all the way down and then recharge it no longer than 18 hours. It glows, like a glow worm does, not very bright. The light is barely bright enough to see baby to check up on him and not bright enough to change a diaper buy, even in the brightest setting. I carried the light and put it right in the crib, just inches from baby's face, and could barely see him. I did see on the internet that there are two styles, one with a base that is listed at $24.95,which they are not making any longer and this one, which is actually listed at $19.95 MSR. I think it's cute, but at $23, I think it's over priced. UPDATE: one night I unplugged the night light at 8pm, at 2 am I went into my grandson's room to turn off the humidifier and the Mobi light was already off. It didn't even last 6 hours. It says it should 10 to 12 hours. I have twice let it run down all the way and charged it all day, abut 12 hours, and it didn't even get 6 hours of night light. I've seen the light selling for as low as $17 but you have to pay extra for shipping.",3
MOBI Portable Rechargeable Light Blue,"We recently ordered this night light for our 3 month old son. It is great for the early morning feedings. We don't have to turn on all the lights anymore! It has 3 settings; low(dim), medium(a bit brighter than low) and then a timer setting. We love it!",5
MOBI Portable Rechargeable Light Blue,"I bought this for my 2 and 1/2 year old when we transitioned to a ""big boy bed"" in a new room and he loved having a new special light.  It is very bright and colorful.  The charge only lasts 10 hours as it says and it must be recharged again during the day.  12 hours would be ideal but 10 works.  It is a fun, useful night light.",4
MOBI Portable Rechargeable Light Blue,5 stars !! I give it 10 stars great for baby room safe and works very well indeed..,5
MOBI Portable Rechargeable Light Blue,We got this for our son for his room and it's the perfect night light for him! he loves it and loves to put it out at night by himself. the glow is perfect for his room and i love the settings from dim to bright. with his 3rd birthday coming up we're finding that we're going to have to replace it because after using it nightly for almost 3 years it's now hardly staying on at all. completely worth the money but wish the charge lasted longer!,4
MOBI Portable Rechargeable Light Green,"I bought two of these lights, because I think they are a great idea. However, the charge did not last more than a couple of hours so I contacted the seller who quickly put me in touch with Mobi. They promptly sent me two replacements and now I have 4. A great idea for a night light and my daughters use them every night, for the past year. My disappointment is that none of the 4 lights hold their charge for longer than 4 hours, one only for 2 hours. Would not be an issue if I hadn't had my expectations heightened by the claim that they last for up to 10 hours. I would recommend to anyone but shop around for the best price and don't count on a 10 hour charge.",3

MOBI Portable Rechargeable Light Yellow,"I specifically ordered this light because it is shown with a rechargeable base instead of a cord that plugs into the back. I received a plain old Tykelight  with a charging cord. I am very disappointed and now have to deal with shipping this back and hopefully getting this resolved in a timely manner. In the meantime, my kid won't have a nightlight when she goes to Grandma's next week. Aaargh!Do not order this product if you are expecting a light on a base - that is not what you will receive! If I wanted a plain old Tykelight, I would have gone to Target.",1
"The First Years Compass Deluxe Folding Adjustable Booster,  Camouflage","Ever since my daughter graduated to a booster seat, my now 4-year old son has been campaigning for a ""grown-up"" seat of his own. She has an animal print Britax Star Riser, which has been fine but uncomfortable for long journeys. Her head seems to flop all over and she complains of a bad backache after 45 minutes or so.When it came time to retire the mammoth Britax Marathon that he was in, we looked high and low for a good booster. At the recommendation of a friends, we considered the Compass. While not MY first choice in patterns, my son loved the camo (very manly), and it seemed much more comfortable than the Britax with the same safety features. It is light and easy to take out and put in the car. My son has no problem falling asleep in the seat, which will improve everyone's mood during long car trips.All in all, excellent value for the price.",5
"The First Years Compass Deluxe Folding Adjustable Booster,  Camouflage","This is an excellent booster seat.  I bought this for my son who is now 4 years old and 49 pounds.  Finding a seat for him was hard because of his size.  He is a big, tall kid.  He is very comfortable in this seat.  It is also great because we share it with my mom and my nanny.  It is easy to move from car to car and it is easy to store.  If you plan to travel, I would highly recommend getting the bag to go with it.",5
The First Years Carry Bag For Compass Booster,"This bag has decent construction and fits the booster seat well, but that's about it. For air travel, it's better than nothing, but also has some disadvantages. It doesn't do anything more than cover the seat--there's no foam padding or anything like that to provide extra protection for the seat against damage caused in baggage handling. (But what do you expect for around $20, I guess?) More importantly, the strap is not removable, and there's no way to secure it to the bag so that it doesn't flap around. This greatly increases the chance of the bag (and seat inside) getting lost, damaged, or delayed during airport baggage handling, as loose straps can get caught in the automatic baggage handling machinery. Be sure to identify the bag as containing a car seat when checking in at the airport, as most major airlines will have a separate handling procedure for car seats that might spare you the inconvenience of a damaged/lost bag and seat.",3
"Compass Premier Folding, Adjustable Booster","I love this car seat because it is sporty, easy to use and convenient. I can easily lift my child into the seat or he can climb on his own. The arm rests fold down or up easily and the cupholders on both sides are great. Plus, it is really comfortable with the memory foam. It would also be great for someone who needs to take it to travel because it is lightweight and comes with a nice travel bag.",5
The First Years Compass Deluxe Folding Booster Car Seat - Giraffe,"I have always used Britax car seats and love them!! I did a lot of comparisons to the Britax Monarch. I really, really like that the armrests on the Compass fold up; it is so useful when securing the belt. Portability is great...we move it from Grandma & Grandpas car to ours in a snap, not heavy or bulky, like most Brtiax (Monarch weighs 5 lbs more). My husband takes our daughter to school, then folds up the seat to allow for more room in the truck for his work, then just unfolds it when he picks her up. Works great! Love the safety specs - it has surpassed International Side Impact Standards. Definitely glad we chose this seat & would recommend it to anyone.",5
The First Years Compass Deluxe Folding Booster Car Seat - Giraffe,"For ease of use it's great, after you fold it a few times and figure out how it works. My Great Niece Hailey a discriminating [...] looked at it, said I don't like it but when she sat down in it discovered the cup holders, shoulder belt (no 5 point harness), and comfortable seat she was sold. We adjusted the seat to her height and she just loves it. It easily removes to switch cars, is light weight and has a built in handle.",5
The First Years Compass Deluxe Folding Booster Car Seat - Giraffe,"We were looking for a booster seat that my 5yo daughter and I could both agree on. I was concerned for safety since she would be giving up her Evenflo Triumph. She cared about appearence and comfort. My husband has an Evenflo big kid deluxe in his car, and it's okay for short trips. Long trips, which we make quite frequenty, she complained about the seat not being comfortable after awhile. I searched everywhere and found the Compass when I was looking at safety ratings. The seats are wider and plusher from everything else I've seen. Plus, I couldn't resist the adorable giraffe print, and that was a hit with my daughter as well. I also liked how the shoulder strap has a designated area where it goes through and across my daughters chest at the right angle, so she doesn't complain about the strap being so close to her neck. A common problem we have with my husbands booster!",5
The First Years Compass Deluxe Folding Booster Car Seat - Giraffe,"Well, it's that time. My small 5 year old daughter has hit the milestone of graduating to the big girl seat. We have been using our beloved BRITAX ROUNDABOUT for as long as we possibly could. It was an easy choice, to get another Britax...until they discontinued the cowmooflage parkway model that i wanted to move into. So i asked friends who own a compass, poured over info at many babystore sites. I could just not buy the junk flimsy seats that i see in most stores. I saw the Giraffe print here at amazon first and was reassured that this Compass was the answer. I didn't want the basic version from the store, my daughter was going to get a FUN one. Kudos to Compass for understanding that making the seats comfy &'cool' is key to getting kids to willingly sit in a booster.From order to door, this amazing seat arrived in less than 3 days with super saver shipping! (of course, i am on the same coast as the distribution center, but Amazon has always shipped my orders within just hours of ordering) SEAT DETAILS; I was pleasantly surprised that the 'spots' are BLACK not chocolate(if you care about that sort of thing like i do ;) What gives her *****? Build quality, fabrics, ergonomics, genius design from folding down forward, adjustable FULL back, to the smooth bottom to protect your leather seats...it's a no brainer. We have moved from Britax to Compass with ease. Or Cow to Giraffe...*Check out that camouflage version for your little man too!*",5
The First Years Compass Deluxe Folding Booster Car Seat - Giraffe,"I did a lot of research for booster seats and this one was a definite ""Yes!"". The Compass seat is the only one that folds down, making it excellent for travel, especially on an airplane. My husband just left for deployment to Kuwait for 7 months and I knew I'd be taking a lot of plane trips during the time he was gone. I needed a seat that was safe, comfortable for my daughter, easy to transport, and easy to keep clean. The cover of the seat snaps off easily in different pieces so you only have to wash the pieces that got soiled. I threw it in the washing machine on the hand wash cycle and then air dried it....no more struggling to get the 1-piece cover off for 20 minutes and struggling to get it back on for 20 minutes or longer. The seat adjusts easily in the car and it takes about 5 seconds to fold it down for travel. She loves the armrests and the hidden cupholders and the wrap-around head piece is the perfect size so she can still see out the window and she has head support when she falls asleep. I did purchase the $19.99 bag for the carrier so I could check it with our baggage on the airlines. the bag unzips completely so you just lay the seat in it. I would recommend this seat to anyone!!!!  The print is adorable, my daughter loves it and it smooth and comfortable. I am in love!!!!",5
The First Years Compass Deluxe Folding Booster Car Seat - Giraffe,"I bought this booster for my 3 1/2 year old son who's very tall for his age.  When I saw the Compass seats and their folding capability, I knew I wanted one.  However, the local Target store only carried the weird lime green color.  I decided to go with the deluxe version because of the fabric choices - I liked the giraffe print as I thought it would hide dirt better some of the other colors.  We've been using the seat for about a month and my son really loves it!  He can get into the seat without any assistance and he likes the flip up/down armrests.  The padding and seat seem very comfortable to him, with a deep enough seat that his legs are at a comfortable resting angle.  He's not used the cup holders yet.  He recently got sick in the car which required me to test how well the fabric and seat cleaned up - it passed with flying colors!!  What I really appreciated was that the bottom seat cushion cover actually snaps off separately from the back pieces, so you can easily remove just that portion for a quick cleaning.I agree with another reviewer that folks should be aware that the height of the seat back may interfer with your rear-view visability, depending on placement.  I don't have a problem with that if the seat is in the far right/far left positions of my back seat, only if it is placed in the center of the back seat.  But that might be the case for most full-back booster seats with adjustable heights - not just with a Compass seat.We've not had a problem with the fabric being too ""grabby"" that it interfers with my son's clothing, but he mostly wears jeans and windpants that are smoother fabrics.  I like the soft feel of the fabric - I would be more concerned if the fabric was smoother because he might slip around in the seat too much!Overall, I would highly recommend this seat - very user friendly, very comfortable for my child, has excellent safety features and ratings, and yet still stylish.",5
The First Years Compass B510 Deluxe Folding Adjustable Booster Car Seat - Aspen,"I would highly recommend this product to keeping your little one safe.My grandson loves his booster seat. Easy to use, good quality material on the seat, folds very easy and portable. I purchased two of these seats, one for my car and one for my daughter's car.",5
The First Years Compass B510 Deluxe Folding Adjustable Booster Car Seat - Aspen,"I ordered two of the Compass booster seats for my 3 year old daughter.  We received this seat within one week, in original packaging and my daughter loves her ""Big Girl"" seat.  I researched many boosters - this was affordable and comfortable.My other seat is another story... It arrived also within one week (ordered and received first week of Feb) not in the original box (in a B505 box which was TOO small) and the seat foam was cracked/falling apart and the seat frame was cracked.  Working with the vendor/Happy Mothers has NOT been easy.  Lots of phone tag, e-mails CONSTANT follow up on my part.  Just today which is 3/9 - a month later... they assured me Compass was sending my new seat as of Tues 3/6.  Yes, I got a person because finally they gave me a cell phone number to contact.  Otherwise it's always a voice mail!I'm used to customer service like Babies R Us or Pottery Barn Kids - where things are taken care of within one week and I'm confident things will be taken care of.The ""Price was Right"", but the vendor/Happy Mothers is a mess!",5
The First Years Compass B510 Deluxe Folding Adjustable Booster Car Seat - Aspen,"This car seat has been great, my daughter is very comfortable in it.  We bought the boster with a high back because it has a head rest for long trips.  She sleeps just fine in this one because the head sides turn in more than other seats. It folds for storage and is easy to travel with, I can fold it and carry it through the airport easily because it is so light.  I was concerned about the light color getting dirty quickly but it is washable.",5
"The First Years Ultra Folding Booster Seat, Cappuccino","The booster seat fits great in my small SUV. My daughter can buckle herself and she's comfortable, as well as safe.",4
"The First Years Ultra Folding Booster Seat, Cappuccino","We bought this seat for our 6 year old who is on the smaller side and has been 5pt harnessed up until now. I was very nervous about transitioning, and did a great deal of research before settling on this seat. Its proven to be a great find. Sure, the cup holders are a bonus, the moveable armrests make things easier, and the print is just too cute. But I was most interested in making sure that the belt threaded through safely and securely and at an appropriate height. I am so happy to report it has been great. It fits exactly where it is supposed to, at the chest and across the lap (don't forget to adjust the neck support- its so easy!). The folding feature is nice too as we generally used this seat for summertime daycare trips and it went easily into other cars. We still primarily use a 5pt harness in our other car, and for longer trips, but when we're comfortable enough transitioning to full time booster seat use, we'll definitely get another of these.",5
"The First Years Ultra Folding Booster Seat, Cappuccino",These are perfect seats for my grandkids. This is the third one that I bought. I love the fact that they fold in half and I can keep it in the trunk and always have it when I need it.Every grandparent should have one,5
"The First Years Ultra Folding Booster Seat, Cappuccino","We have two of these seats.  My oldest son has been in it a year, and my younger one just got one like it for Christmas.  My oldest son's has held up really well and still looks new.  I have washed the cover on it a few times.  It's great, because it literally snaps off.  So it's no trouble at all to wash it.  The seat is well padded, and the material, while not exactly waterproof is easy to wipe clean with a damp rag.  My boys both like having two cup holders which can open or close flush with the seat.  The seat folds in half easily for carrying it from car to car, and seems to be comfortable as car seats go.  This seat is definitely worth the money.",5
"The First Years Ultra Folding Booster Seat, Cappuccino","I bought this chair for my soon to be 3 year old son who has outgrown his convertible car seat and kept complaining about back pain whenever I would strap him in.  I got my 4 year old son a First Years Compass booster seat when he turned 3. He loves it for it's comfort and I love it because it's held up remarkably well after almost two years of every day use.  I know the high quality of this brand first hand and that's why I knew I wanted another one for my younger son. Let me say that I was hesitant at first because I wasn't too sure about the colors of this particular model, but the safety, ease of use, and low price factors convinced me to overlook my aesthetic concerns:)  However, in person, the green is actually a rich apple color that contrasts nicely with the deep brown and what seems harsh to the eye onscreen is very nice in person.  So now I have a comfortable, safe, and easy to use ""big boy"" car seat that both my son and I love and is not hard to look at! I'm really happy I took a chance and definitely recommend it!",5
"The First Years Ultra Folding Booster Seat, Cappuccino","The seat is easy to use and made of great quality products.  When buckling the seat belt, it is nice to be able to push the armrests up and out of the way.  It is easy to travel with because it folds up so small and is very lightweight.  My 5 year old son is always excited to use his big boy seat!  He really likes its sporty look.  The only thing missing, which I knew would be, was having the 5 point harness option.

The First Years Compass Premier Folding Adjustable Booster - Pacific,"I'm a bit of a car seat freak for kids. When my daughter was too big for regular car seats and needed to graduate to a booster, I initially bought her a backless wlittle one. That wasn't horrible but I could see that she wasn't really comfortable and downright miserable on longer trips. This seat was recommended to me by a good friend. My daughter loves it. Loves the cupholders. Loves that it's roomy. It folds in half t easily leave at school for after class playdates.",5
The First Years Compass Premier Folding Adjustable Booster - Pacific,Very nice seat. The industry must do something to improve the child safety seat systems but this one is at least easy to use and looks like it would be safe. Easier to put on seat belt than others I have used. Recommend.,5
Lascal Kiddy Guard Wall Gate 1 ea,"There is no way you will ever get this gate open with a baby in your arms.  It is aesthetically well designed and flows well in the house since it rolls up nicely. However, it is not practical for a high/moderate traffic area of the house.  We have it covering a large opening from the kitchen and constantly end up with either the top or the bottom hook attached but rarely both.The problem with the install is not complexity but rather precision.  I finally got the install right after 3 holes in the wall.  It is tricky since you really have to accurately line up the hooks in order to get good tension on both the top and bottom. If you don't have a level and measuring tape you will end up with a few holes in the wall/door.",2
Lascal Kiddy Guard Wall Gate 1 ea,"This is a great idea; a child gate that rolls up and is easy to deploy and retract and mounts in a wide varity of openings.  And, once installed, the gate does work very well and seems strudy.However, the unit is NOT designed to be installed with a baseboard or corner round and if thoes are present you have to purchase a rather costly adaptor set which addresses the baseboard but not the corner round.  For that you need to use a bit creative instalation and use parts from the kit to 'make it work'.  For over $100 each I would expect a better designed unit.That said, we do like these and if you are OK with the complex install or don't have the baseboard/corner round issues this is the only product of its type that I know of.",3
Lascal Kiddy Guard Wall Gate 1 ea,".......after reviewing and seeing all other types.  I had the worst situation, hallow wall on one side, iron railing on the other side, so had to get adapters for both sides. To my surprise, the iron railing side was more easy to attach.  My railing is 2 inch each side squares, so to let people out there that have the same railings the adapter works.  (see attached pics)The hallow wall side took some adjustments and I had to do it twice, so I had to get other toggle bolts.The instructions is the main reason I am not giving 5 stars.  One the print is so small.  And in my opinion the wording and pictures is just not clear.Yes the locking system can be a little tricky but its not impossible and as hard as I see others write about.  Like everything else its a matter of getting used to.The cost it seems like the most expensive one out there.  But since I think its the best and its for the protection of my son, then cost does not matter.",4
Lascal Kiddy Guard Wall Gate 1 ea,"We got this gate for the top of the stairs since a swing gate would have blocked access to our son's room.  It was difficult to install even with the wall installation kit and my husband had to go out and buy additional screws that were longer.  Now that it is installed, it works fine, but is not particularly easy to use, especially with one hand.  It is noisy when it retracts unless you hold the unlock button down, so that can be annoying.  It's also hard to latch- I always miss the bottom attachment and then I have to unlock and start over.  But, it keep our son from getting near the stairs and we were able to install it at a slight angle which you can't do with most other gates. So it was probably the best option for our house although I think it is kind of pricey for what you get.  It is nice that it is not in the way when it's open and that even the part that is visible pretty much blends into the wall.",3
Lascal Kiddy Guard Wall Gate 1 ea,"Wow, great concept!  It is really cool to not have to worry about a big, clunky monster of a baby gate.  Sturdy enough to keep tantrum throwing 15 month old at bay!  I CAN step over this gate when I don't feel like messing with retracting it, but it's a stretch... I'm 5' 7"".  It definitely is fussy to open and close, people that can operate it smoothly one-handed might also be witches or magicians.  Even two-handed takes some getting used to, I definitely swore at it a few times.  Otherwise, it's a really good product!",4
Lascal Kiddy Guard Wall Gate 1 ea,"Ok, I'll be honest - we never even got these installed. My dad, who is VERY mechanically inclined and my husband spent half an hour trying to figure out how to even unroll it. Then, they spent another hour trying to figure out how they were going to rig it up so it would work with our stairs. We have the carpet covered baseboards and then a chair-rail like trim. Even with the extra installation kit, it was going to be a HUGE challenge. But, the deciding factor in my sending these back was how hard they were to open. I have elderly in-laws and several different babysitters who were ALL going to need to use these to go up and down the stairs several times a visit. It was just too hard for me to try to remember the 3 steps it took to open them, let alone asking all those other people to do it. I sent them back and ordered an accordian style gate instead. We'll see how it goes!",1
Lascal Kiddy Guard Wall Gate 1 ea,"We have 5 of these gates in our home, we love it that much.  If you aren't into tripping through metal or wood safety gates all the time and want something aesthetically pleasing and easy to clean, this is finally your solution.Once you figure out how to operate the button - yes, with one hand - you just push your body ""through"" the gate to give some slack and then unhook it.  I think the trick is just figuring this out!!  Many parents have posted they can't figure out how to operate w/ one hand - - it really DOES work.  Also, there was a post about molding.  We just mounted a 1/2cm taller to go above the molding.  A matchbox car can get under but the child can't.We do have an old home, plaster walls, and thick baseboard molding.  So we mount a vertical board (and paint it white to match the molding) onto the wall, then mount the ""hooks"" onto that.  Works like a charm.We keep the kids enclosed in or out of various areas of the home - play room area, kitchen area, family room, top of basement steps, etc.I can't say more things about this amazing gate.  When we have friends over or are leaving a particular area of our home and no longer need the gate up, we leave it rolled up and have a lovely view (no gate).  When the kids are around, gates are unrolled and we are in business and safe. We also use the gate to block off the kitchen from our dog when we are having guests in the dining or living rooms (before the gate, our dog started eating the Thanksgiving turkey on the kitchen counter)..I love these things. I am thinking about getting 2 more (one to block stairs up to the attic, and another in the upstairs hallway...Oh, I can't wait.super safety conscious Mom of 4 under 6",5

"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green","I purchased this product to use for both of my children (ages 2 and 10 mos at the time). The thermometer itself is very cute, appears sturdy and well-built, and quickly gives out a temperature reading and even beeps if the water is too hot or too cold. However I am rating it so low because the thermometer stopped working after about 3 weeks of ""normal"" use. It did begin working again after resting for about a week (my husband used it, not knowing that it had previously stopped working), but then about 3 days after that it stopped working again. Luckily I had carefully read the reviews before purchasing and made sure I could return the item to Amazon since I purchased directly from them as a ""prime"" member. Thank goodness I took those precautions or I'd be out over $10 for a defective thermometer!!!  I'd recommend not wasting your time with this one and get one that's more reliable.",2

"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green","We've been using this thermometer for the baby's bath since she was born. She is now 9 months old. It simply lets me know what the temp of the water is in an easy to read digital screen on top. It turns itself on and off when being taken in and out of the water. The baby plays with it now and likes to watch it spin as it sits in the tub with her. It has shown no signs of mold or mildew, but I do tap it on the tub when I have taken it out of the water to dry. It also beeps when it goes too low or too high of temperature. The quality is good enough that I expect it to last through our next child. Both baby and I are pleased.",5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green",I love this product. I had not thought about a bath thermometer for my newborn until I realised I was ""guessing"" if her bath water was too warm. this thermometer is very easy to use out of the box. no set up and beeps until water is safe in either too hot or too cold directions. highly recommend this product. shipped on time and well packaged,5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green","This was great as I was a new mom who was worried about not only getting my baby's water temperature too hot, but also having it too cold. This thermometer is great and tells you the temperature every couple of seconds so you know if the water is cooling down also. I have a newborn so she doesn't use this as a toy yet but I'm sure she will as soon as she can grab a hold of it. It is so cute and does what I need it to.",5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green",The thermometer stooped working after couple months like for everyone else. I purchased new batteries but they weren't the problem. I guess I shouldn't have placed the thing in the water.,1
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green","Works entirely like it's supposed to.  The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5, is that when the bath is over and therefore no more hot water, the cold water alarm goes off.  Probably just lazy operator who cant find the off switch.  Oh well",4
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green","Honestly after the first week of bathing my baby, I figured out the temperature that he like to be bathed at just by touching the water. It's great for peace of mind if you're a first time parent but it's not a must have.it takes a while for the temp to show up on the screen and it's kinda hard to read.",3
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green",This makes it so easy to get the bath temperature right. We've used it for almost 4 months- no problems with batteries or other malfunctions.,5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green",I didnt want to burn my child nor did i want to make him hate bath time because it was too cold. This item works great. I would recommend to any parent.,5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green","I bought this thermometer to replace a different brand's turtle thermometer that quickly broke.  This couldn't be easier to use!  This turtle spared us from 126 degree bath water (no joke) on a recent trip to Chicago, and it also lets us know when the water is too chilly to be fun bathtime.",5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green","This thing is awesome! I used to use a thermometer that measures steam milk temp to measure baby's bath water. Got too irritating so I found this little gadget. It's great! The battery is installed out of the box, you simply put it in water and it starts showing you the temp of the water. I try to keep it at 95-97 range since it's the middle ground. Baby loves the bath now and never screamed cuz of hot water anymore...It's pretty big, like toy size. I guess that was the intention of it for being a toy thermometer. For 5 bucks, it's worth every penny.",5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green","This thermometer worked for some time (a few uses, couple of months maybe), but then started showing unreliable temperature readings (lower than actual).So, I suppose it's a clever idea but at least for us, not a particularly useful item anymore.",2
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green","I bought this after I had the kind where it just tells you cool/warm/hot but no temps.  Then I tried the bath tub with the dot that gets white if it's too hot.  Both were very poor in helping me make sure my baby wouldn't get burned.  I use the infant tub that you can put in the kitchen sink, so I like to measure the temp of the water coming out of the water spout sometimes.  This is the perfect item!  It's very quick in changing temps, it has a different beep if the water is too hot, and it floats around like a little bath toy.  When I'm measuring the temp coming out of the water spout I take off the blue plastic cage/cover on the bottom and hit the water directly on the sensor.  It's made me realize that the temp that I think is OK is actually too hot.  When you're done with it, make sure to shake out all the water or it will beep that it's too cold for a while.",5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green",This is a great product for new parents! I searched high and low for this. Bath time is not so stressful anymore.,5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green",Purchased this on recommendation.  Seemed to work ok then stopped working after 3 days.  It was a little slow to adjust from warm to cool spots.,1
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green",Being a new mom I wasn't sure about bath temprature for my baby.  Clever Trever the turtle helped me make the temprature safe for my little man.  I would highly recommend this thermometer to anyone who likes to bath their kids!!!  It will beep when the water is higher then 100.  It will also beep if the water is too cold.  The only annoying this about Trever is that when you take it out of the water when done bathing it will beep and beep until all of the water is out of it's shell.  The way to fix the annoying beeping is to shake the water out of it.  We use Trever everytime it's bath time at my house.,5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green",I'm very happy with this purchase! It is cute and functional. My baby is 2 months old now and I'm sure she will have a lot of fun with it in a few months.,5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green",The bath thermometer is cute and works well for telling you if the water is too hot or too cold.  The only issue so far is when it is removed from the water it continues to beep for at least 20mins. The packaging states it will turn off automatically after being out of the water for a few seconds.  I wish this was true.  It would be much nicer if it had a manual off and on switch.,3
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green",My baby seems to love this toy during bath time as she plays with it more than her rubber ducky. I know every child is different so to me it was quite useful. The temperature does the trick to having a nice warm bathing temp for my baby so I can know if the water is too cold or too hot. must buy!,5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green","beeps when too cold or too hot, shows temp to the tenths in english units (degrees F) and metric (degrees C), the water goes in the bottom, comes out the bottom, does not seem to be affected by frequent dunkings!  not much else to say, it floats...  I use it for my daughter's bath water since her first bath, and for my bath water too!",5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green",I love these! My first one messed up because we left it in the shower and it fizzled out but this new one is wonderful!,5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green",thank you the bath thermometer alarm is exactly what I wanted.  This is for a baby shower gift.  Thanks again.,5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green","I loved this at first.  The product itself works great and I love that I can check the temperature for my son's bath.  But, for some reason, they made the turtle's head come in two pieces and after a short while of using this, the head now comes off and because it's two pieces, they aren't very big, making this a choking hazard for my son.  Also, the piece that the head snaps onto is not good for my son to be putting in his mouth as it's small as well and could break off.  We have only used this in the bath and he rarely even plays with this, so it should have lasted longer than this.I'm very disappointed with this as otherwise it works great.  Not sure why they needed to put small pieces for the head on this.",1
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green",I used this in the beginning of bath time for my little girl.  I still wanted to make sure the water temp was correct.  I loved it!  It worked every time and just reassured me.  I do not use it any longer now that I am accustom to what temperature she likes.,5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green","I use it at every bath. Works great, measures the temperature quickly. Looks very cute. I was happy it shows the temperature in Celsius as well since I am used to this metric system. I have used it for the last 4 months and it is good as new. Recommend.",5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green","I bought it and it last it for about 4 months - then it stopped working for no reason. I changed the battery, open it to find what might be wrong to no avail.Just save your money unless you don't mind to change it some months after your purchase!",1
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green","So far so good.  I put this in our baby tub, and it seemed accurate.  I like it's look and how it operates.  This would be a good gift for a new mom or dad.",5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green","After a few first baths for my newborn we quickly realized how imperative it was to have a thermometer for the bath water,  I purchased this one because it was super cute (looks like a bath toy) and because it beeps to tell you when the water is too hot or too cold.  It works flawlessly and I love using it because it takes the guess worm out of setting the right water temperature,  easy to operate, accurate.  It's a little big for a newborn bath, so once we've set up the water, we take it out, but when my son gets older I look forward to leaving it in as a toy,",5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green","This was very useful when I first got it and it worked.  As a nervous new mother I wanted to make sure the bath temperature was exactly right.  Then, after a few weeks of use, the thermometer starting getting wildly inaccurate readings.  The alarm would go off and the display would read something like 105 degrees when the water was tepid.  I'm really glad that the temperature reading was so inaccurate, because it was obvious that it was wrong.  If it was just slightly inaccurate, I might have taken much longer to notice it was off.  If you do use this product, be sure to also test the water yourself with the common sense test (as they say - use the inside of your arm, which has very sensitive skin, to make sure it's not too hot).  Don't trust that the temperature is right just because this says it is, or you may end up with a freezing baby or a burned baby bottom (ouch!).",2
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green",This product does exactly what it says. You place it in your baby's bath water and it beeps if it is too cold or too warm. Before I had this I would spend a good 4-5 minutes adjusting the temperature of the water. Then I would second guess myself wondering if I was going to burn my baby with hot water or upset him with too cold water. With the aquatopia thermometer it's perfect every time!,5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green","We loved the Aquatopia so much so that we purchased a second one for my parent's home.  It worked great and was easy to read and operate.  Unfortunately, it only worked for three months.",2
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green","I can't believe this got so many 5 stars. We got this to measure the temperature in our newborns bath. The first few uses went fine but then the last digit failed to show up clearly. Very disappointed that by his 10th bath, none of the numbers showed up! Now we just use it as a bath toy and switched to one of those little ducks that just tells you hot/cold.",1
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green","Any item like this is no substitute for adult supervision... That being said, I am very satisfied that I bought this item (for $8.24), would buy it again if mine broke for some reason, and would happily recommend it as a gift. I agree with all the listed product features but I reordered them based on my priorities:1. Alerts you with an audible alarm if the water is too hot (>100.4 F / 38 C) or if the water is too cold (&lt;89.6 F/ 32 C) as a reminder to keep the water temperature in a comfortable range2. Reads bath temperature and updates the digital display (in F and C) every 2 seconds (although rapidly updates, remember to account for a gradient from a running faucet)3. Makes a fun floating toy as well (green smiling turtle on one side and the flip side blue dotted mound can be an ""iceberg"" for other bath toys to stand on)4. Activates automatically (display turns on when water contacts the sensors in the base, and deactivates when the water drains out) which saves the LR44 1.5V button battery5. Easy to use with no buttons (has been very reliable for the 2 years that I've used it so far, including being dropped numerous times)Because you can see a near-instant digital display of the water temperature, there is no comparison for this product to those that have heat-activated ""HOT"" printed on on them (which at least for my Munchkin duck and bathtub grippy dots, start to turn white at a still-comfortable 98ish Fahrenheit). It is very useful to see the display to adjust to a consistent water temperature during bath time no matter what your room temperature is currently (since how warm your own body is compared to the ambient air will affect how comfortable you think the water is when you test it with your hand). I find it useful whether your goal is to create a warm bath for playtime or to make a tepid bath to help reduce a fever.",5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green","I bought this as a first time mom because I was worried about everything. Also, I'm not good at judging water temperature for a baby since my own preference is practically scalding. I'm really glad I bought this. It's cute and easy to use. After all, it just floats around, displays the temperature, and beeps if it gets too hot or too cold. You will definitely hear the beeping too. It's not insanely loud or anything, but it won't be missed. It's a good size so it's easy to read the temperature and a good size for kids to play with. My daughter is a toddler now and still likes to play with her turtle so it is a good toy as well. Definitely worth buying for the peace of mind.",5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green","This thermometer works great... it's water activated so it turns on in the water, and turns off after I take it out.  It beeps if the water temperature drops below 90 degrees or goes above 100.  Overall it's great, the only problem is that the battery runs out after 6 months or so, and I can't figure out how to buy the right battery to replace it.  We just burnt out our second turtle, and am about to buy the third but I think i'll try the Turtlemeter instead for hopes of a longer battery life.",3
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green",As soon as you set it in the water it quickly starts reading the temp. If the temp is over 100 degrees an alarm goes off indicating a high temp and doesn't stop beeping until the water is cooled down (or you take it out). It also looks cute floating around in the bath :).I am currently using this for myself as I'm 34 weeks pregnant and usually like my bath water hot. I wasn't confident enough to take baths until I got a thermometer and now I take one nightly. This little turtle will get a lot of use once our baby boy is born.,5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green",I bought this thermometer to measure the bath water while I was pregnant. I will continue to use it when the baby comes.,5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green","It was great for 1.5 month and then it lost its waterproof quality, the water spread through the indicative panel one day and that was the end of it.",1
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green",We used this a lot when my daughter was an infant. I am not sensitive to extremely hot water and I always think water isn't as hot as it really is. I used this to teach myself what temperature to use for my daughters baths. I was amazed about how hot I made the water and had to drain the tub many times before I put her in because I made it too hot. I am very happy we had this when she was born. The only annoying thing about it is that it sometimes gets water in it and it beeps after the bath and it can take a little time to try to shake it out to shut it up. Not terrible though. Overall it was a good purchase for us.,5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green","As others have said, the beeping and delays between updates can become annoying, but that aside, the thermometer worked great...for about 7 months (daily use). About a week ago it just stopped working. I've tried shaking it out, new batteries...nothing is working. :( I guess it is time to break out the munchkin ducky tub that has the color changing 'hot' sensor in the bottom! My son likes that better than his hard plastic tub anyway and he's still too small for the big tub.",2
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green",This worked really well for preparing baths for our baby girl.  The battery lasts a good while and it's durable.  Good for a new parent that wants to take the guess work out of having the right temp. for bath time.,4

"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green",You just drop it in the bath tub and you get a temperature.It beeps if it get too hot.,5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green",I so really love this product. It's well worth the peace of mind and so easy to just throw it in and out and no big deal if your little one plays with it (but mine likes his toys and tends to leave it alone).  Turns out my baths I was running were a tad cold and I know someone you (obviously unintentionally) slightly scalded there baby with the bath. When the battery gets low you know it. It seems to go haywire. Battery doesn't seem to last the longest but maybe that was just the first ones that come from the store and we'll see how long these ones last.,4
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green","it works but I would not buy it again or recommend it to someone.it doesn't update the temperature as the water temperature changes you have to take it out of the water, and shake all the water out of It. then you can put it back in the water to get you reading at that time.",2
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green","I've had the Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer turtle in service for 2 years now and it's never let me down. I wouldn't dream of bathing my son without it. When he was born I used other bath temp toys but they were toys and just not accurate. We got a different brand digital bath temp turtle but it didn't have the decimal place, temp was only in F, and it read 2 deg lower than real temp which could be dangerous. So beware other brands and go with the most accurate. It flips over easy when my son's in the tub, making it cold and getting the alarm to sound. I just flip it back and swoosh it a few times under water to get it to stop. I use it for my own baths - just over into the alarm range is perfect. When the alarm goes off it's hard to make it stop. You either have to shake it hard 20 times or unscrew the round bottom to get the water out. When I was pregnant the doc said I couldn't bathe in water over a certain temp, so this make sure we stayed safe! We always take it on vacation too.",5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green",i loved this product untill it broke which was only about 5 months.for such a pricey item i would expect it to work longer.,2
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green","As new parents this was one of the best buys we have made. Bathing the baby in the right temperature water is so important! We use it every time the baby has a bath. We use around 36.5 on cold days and around 34-35 on hotter days. A must have if you want to be sure the baby is not getting too hot or too cold water to bathe. I know for years parents depend on their touch to determine if the temperature is ok, but just to make sure we got this.",5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green",Always use it to get the bathtub to a nice 36 Celsius (human body temperature). Totally recommended no complains! just great.,5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green","I never quite knew if i had the right temperature, always had the concern it could be too hot (arghhh) or chilly but this has been a blessing. I can put my son in the bath without all the elbow in water or honey can you check this..... great little invention, just bought one for my expecting sister I like it that much.",5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green","I was a bit hesitant to purchase this bath thermometer after reading some of the negative reviews on Amazon, but since it appeared to be the best option available, I took the plunge anyway.  And I'm glad I did.  We've had it for a few weeks and it works as well as it should and better than some of the reviewers indicated.It gets the bath to a temperature my 2-month-old son is happy with every time and hasn't quit working on us yet.  It's very nice to know for sure that the bath water is a temperature that your baby can handle, especially if you are one that is desensitized to hot water or overly cautious about turning up the temperature on your baby's bath.  This pretty much guarantees that you'll get it right every time.There was one bath that it didn't want to turn on for, but it was fine the next day.  That one day as well the item's unknown future performance are the only reasons I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.",4
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green","Love the product but broke within 7 months!  So, not recommended.  Worked the first 6 months and made our life easy.  HOW DID IT BREAK SO EASILY?  I guess you only need the product to make sure the water's not too hot for your guy.  Loved knowing the temperature of the water.  Oh well.  Planned obselescence (sp?).",2
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green","used only a couple of times.  after i got the hang of the temperature that was needed, no longer used this.",3
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green",Love the digital display and the warning beeps.,5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green","I was excited to get this. It works well for my daughter who is old enough to just start learning to take baths herself as well as for my newborn son. I know my daughter can check the water temperature to get her bath just right before getting in. I also have peace of mind bathing my little baby. When my daughter was little we had a rubber ducky that changed color if the water was too hot, but it was slow to work and also didn't alert you if the water was too cold. I love that this one makes a beeping noise to let you know if the water isn't within a safe and comfortable range.My daughter was playing with it and the turtle snapped off the yellow part and I can't seem to get them snapped back together but they can be put together and still work great they just separate easily.The temperature does seem to be accurate but I haven't tested it with another thermometer but we have been using it for weeks with success.",5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green","I really like this item. It immediately tells you the temperature and beeps if it is too hot or cold. As a new Mom, it's hard to know the correct temperature for water and this lets you know asap. Every parent should have this in their tub.",5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green","The thermometer does its job nicely, alarm you when the water is too hot or too cold, I have no complaint on its functionality.  It is the beeping noise that bother both my baby and I.  The beepings are just too annoying.  I find the bottom cover, which seems like protecting the sensor rod, is useless.  It just collects water inside, making it take longer to dry after use.  I just use it without the bottom cover since day one.",3
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green",It is slow to read the true temperature. Takes a few minutes to show something that seems like a true temperature. After about 20 uses does not turn on well (you have to submerge it fully and kind of hit it agains the bottom). Would not recommend this item.,2
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green",An absolutely must have and must buy. This product eases your mind in the temperature of the water for your baby.,4
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green","Takes a while to get a reliable reading.  Broke after 18 months of daily use, doesn't light up any more.",2
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Easy Bath Kneeler, Blue",I use this to bathe my dogs. it works wonders.,5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Easy Bath Kneeler, Blue",Great padding and your knees will thank you :) I love the extra pockets for having everything handy. My tub is a bit low so this is not a perfect fit but it's workable. Also the padding for your elbows is great as well. Well worth it!,5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Easy Bath Kneeler, Blue","This thing is awesome! Anything else we tried (pillow, towel, etc) to kneel on while bathing our son was either awkward, got in the way, didn't help our knees, or all of the above. This product is great! The padding looks too thin, but the thin pad worked better than a thick pillow - without getting in the way. It would be an awesome product if it was just a knee pad, but the nets for bath supplies are an added bonus. I thought the knee pad part was in the way when not in use for bath time... then my wife (the smart one in the relationship) noticed you can flip it up out of the way and it stays up with two small velcro straps.Pros:- Allows you to kneel down and safely bathe your kiddo without killing your knees on the hard bathroom floor!- Knee pad is plenty to protect from a hard tile floor- Net/basket thingies keep bath supplies close.- Velcro straps keep the knee pad out of the way when not in use.Cons:The suction cups to hold it in place in the tub don't hold very well (could just be my tub), but they're not really needed anyway. It pretty much stays in place as is. You're knees hold it still while you're using it.",5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Easy Bath Kneeler, Blue","Our son is now 3 months old and before we got this mat we were using a towel (folded up) under our knees when giving him a bath.  This worked OK but bath time was still a chore because we were still so uncomfortable on our knees. We just tried to hurry and finish his bath instead of letting him enjoy the water and play.  We got this mat for Christmas and LOVE it.  Bath time is now fun for all three of us.  It has so much padding for the knees and also for the arms/ elbows on the edge of the tub.  The suction cups allow it to stay in place while in use and it folds up for easy storage.  We have yet to use the pockets on it but I'm sure they will be useful as time goes on and more bath products are needed.  I would HIGHLY recommend this mat to any parents, grandparents or anyone who has to bathe a child or a pet for that matter!",5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Easy Bath Kneeler, Blue","Go put this on your registry NOW! This thing has saved my knees!!! It's also a space saver. I have baby brush, baby oi, safety swabs and lotion in all the pockets. I could fit so much more too! I LOVE this product.",5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Easy Bath Kneeler, Blue","Perfect for the tub.  Easy to use, we have two boys so we have gotten two of them for the tub.",5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Easy Bath Kneeler, Blue",Why wreck your knees for bath time. So many other times in your life you'll be on your knees. At least be comfortable for baby bath time...,5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Easy Bath Kneeler, Blue","I had this product for a couple of years and it was great, but overtime, got really dirty and was unable to be cleaned, so I decided to replace it.  The new version is terrible!  The suction cups don't stick to the bathtub and they replaced the pockets with a cheap flimsy material which doesn't hold the shampoo bottles.  They definitely should have stuck with the original design, which is what is pictured but not what I received when ordered.",1
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Easy Bath Kneeler, Blue",I bathe 2 little beagles in our tub and this is a knee and elbow saver!  If I am more comfortable the bath goes a lot better - and faster and everybody involved is a big fan of that!,5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Easy Bath Kneeler, Blue","This works very well at bathtime.  The kneeling pads are comfy and it is easy to clean.  The little pockets are nice for storing body wash, lotion, etc.",5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Easy Bath Kneeler, Blue",Whoever thought of this design deserves a pat on the back!  This makes bathtime so much easier! The padding part is so comfortable while kneeling. The pockets are handy for supplies you don't want the kids getting their little paws on.  The suction cups that go on the inside hold the entire thing in place. Great buy!,4
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Easy Bath Kneeler, Blue",It's great that it provides so much cushion for my knees.  and the suction cups really provide a sturdy hold to the tub.,5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Easy Bath Kneeler, Blue","I'm writing this review because I appreciate when people take the time to come back after the product was used for a period of time.At first, I loved this product. It is a good width and the pad had a good thickness. I also like the pockets and that the pad can fold up. After only a few months of use, however, the pad ripped around the suction cups. So now the product isn't actually held to the bathtub (even though the suction cups are still there haha). I'm still using it - it just sits over the tub side but unsecured. It's also starting to get a little moldy looking.Oh well. It was good while it lasted!",3
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Easy Bath Kneeler, Blue","Go buy it at Buy Buy Baby for $24.99, even better use a coupon and get it for $20. I can't believe it is being sold on here for $60",1
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Easy Bath Kneeler, Blue",This simple little bath mat is a knee saver. I can spend alot more time and be alot closer wtih my little ones while giving them a bath. Money worth spent.,5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Easy Bath Kneeler, Blue","This is pretty amazing.  Look at that knee pad, it is thick enough even though it looks thin.  The nice part is those pockets to hold shampoo away from kid's eyesight.  Also that mat velcro's up so it tucks away.  PLUS, if it gets wet, it dries out nice and doesn't get moldy.  Way better than what we were using, which was some gardening pad for the knees and basically balancing bottles on the edge of the tub.  After you use it a couple times, you'll see why everybody likes it.  Quality stuff.  We bought one for a wedding gift and got a second one shipped to us.",5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Easy Bath Kneeler, Blue",I purchased this for my daughter-in-law because she has bad knees and to provide more comfort when she washes her new born baby. She really loves it and said it does not hurt her knees when she bends down. My son also loves it as well. They like the pouches where you do not have to reach far to gather the bathing accessories.,5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Easy Bath Kneeler, Blue",This is a good product. It is comfortable for the knees and arms.  The only complaint I have is that it does not come as clean as I would like after washing it (it tends to mold after some time of use and requires frequent washing).,4
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Easy Bath Kneeler, Blue","What a great product!  Before I found it, My knees and arms would hurt from leaning on them when I would give my daughter a bath.  I highly recommend.",5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Easy Bath Kneeler, Blue",I used to dread giving my daughters baths and now bath time is not a chore at all!  This has totally changed our nighttime routine into a much more pleasant one. We actually take time to bond and play now when I'm giving her a bath! Love this!,5
"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Easy Bath Kneeler, Blue","Husband got me this for bathtime with lil man. SAVED my Knees! but a bit weird with the length of the material. When i lean over to rest my arm, its over a mess part that hurts my arms. I am not sure why that mesh part is there, should be a pad similar to what i kneel on. That would make more sence to me. It looks shorter in the picture but has an odd mesh patch that sits right where i rest my arms and it hurts. So as for kneeling, its great!, As for resting my arms, its kinda awkward.",3
Redmon Original Canvas Bongo Bag,"This Bongo Bag is perfect, first because it is cotton as advertised, a must for me as I am allergic to non cotton materials containing chemicals and, secondly, it has multiple uses, laundry, storage, etc. and folds if you want to put it away.  Size also great, not too big or too small. I love it and will buy more.  Thanks, Redmon.",5
Redmon Original Canvas Bongo Bag,The ""Bongo Bag"" is a very nice clothing storage/hamper that folds flat when not in use. We use these in our kids rooms for their laundry.A good product that works like it should. Recommended!,4
Redmon Original Canvas Bongo Bag,This bag serves the intented purpose of storing my linens.  I just didn't know that it was going to be smaller than I thought.,4
Redmon Original Canvas Bongo Bag,"We use this for our baby's laundry, keeping a separate washable bag inside- it's a good size and blends into the room.",5
Redmon Original Canvas Bongo Bag,I bought this to put in our play room. I put all my daughter's play clothes/dresses in it. It can be used for so many other things as well. It can collapse and is made from very durable material.,5
Redmon Original Canvas Bongo Bag,Convenient size.  Collapsible.  Easy to store.  Easy to empty.  Easy to keep clean.  This item is designed to be used as a hamper.  I also use it as a very large waste basket when needed.,5
Redmon Original Canvas Bongo Bag,"I like this laundry bag because it has a zip enclosure up top and it is not transparent at all (yay privacy!).  The handles make it easy to carry, which is great. Another plus is that it doesn't look slouchy/shifty, regardless of how much stuff you put in it. The wireframe gives it a sturdy look. However, the picture is a bit deceiving because my bag is VERY wrinkly that I've actually thought about ironing it.",4

Stroller Parasol,"We've got the stroller, and found that it doesn't offer a lot of shade, even at the $800 price tag, so we put down another 50 for the umbrella, and it's awful.  We don't even attempt to use it because it is too difficult to position in a way that shields the sun.  You're better off getting a sun shade that ties to the top of the stroller.",1
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,Have 2 year old and we use these when we travel. These are sturdy and fit perfectly under mattress.  They are a bit of a challenge to install so don't loose the instructions.  We will use them for a long time.,5
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"This looks to be a sturdy rail, but it won't fit if the matress fits inside of the bed frame.  Plus, the entire set had to be assembled.  Now that I know it will not work with the bed I have to sell it somewhere else and I can't return it.",2
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"I purchased these rails when my 19 month old daughter moved from her crib to a ""big girl"" twin sized bed. Although the instructions weren't SUPER easy to understand, assembly was completely doable and took me about 30 minutes from start to finish. The rails are very sturdy, fit very tightly to the mattress and have not torn/bent/etc like you see with many bedrails. I like to research and read reviews for every product I purchase from Amazon.com, and I'm  sure that many of you are the same way. I 100% recommend these rails!",5
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,pain to set up but works great and keeps my little one from falling out of bed!! I am very satisfied with my purchase :),5
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"The rails did not make a 90* angle.  It was a smaller angle, meaning it angled itself over the bed rather than straight up.  If you were to stick your hand between the bed & the guard it was almost impossible to pull back out because the angle created such a force that it would trap your hand.  As you tried to pull your hand up it actually would apply more force to keep your hand down.  If I couldn't get my hand out easily, how is my kid going to get his head out easily if he got stuck? There are many other products on the market that are better.",1
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"These rails were solid and good to look at when assembled.  They also do slideunder the mattress without removal when it's time to change the sheets which is very convenient.The assembly instructions could be a little clearer. Assembly time was approx. 20-30 min.  And the rails are not as effective (if you have an active sleeper) when your upper mattress is a deep one.  In our case, the rails only projected about 5"" above the mattress surface, which was fine for our 3 year-old, but might not be sufficient for a younger child.",4
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,Just as described.  Works really well.  Easy to install.  I put mine on a twin and they would have worked better on a full or double bed.  Hard to lower both side because they run into each other under the mattress on a twin bed.  Keeps my very active 5 year old son in his bed and he can raise and lower them by himself.,4
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,Please read the other negative reviews.  This product came broken.  It would have been difficult to put together and was obviously cheaply made.,1
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"My son rolls all over the bed, and this is so sturdy! I love that it can go under the mattress to stow away! Would buy again.",5
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"My husband ended up disregarding the instructions, and he managed to figure it out on his own. The parts are not labeled well, and the booklet is worthless. Even so, the product is easy to use once installed, and it works great! If you can deal with the frustration of the instructions, it's worth buying.",4
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"These rails are higher than the previous rail I purchased, seems sturdier too. Comes in a pack of 2 so perfect for a twin or full size bed.",5
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"After my 3 month old propelled himself off of my mother's full-size bed, we decided it was time to get some protective railing.  He is long and I wanted to get something that would cover most of the b ed.  This install was easy, the material is still intact and my son has not fallen anymore.  It swings down.  It hides under the mattress.  Like all the other reviews that I have read about this product, it does buck the mattress up a little on both side but that is ok.  I am more concerned about my son's safety instead of the bucking of the mattress.",5
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"plan and simple, do not buy this cheap cr*p.. with a 2 1\\4 inch bars that run under the bed and less height then promised, this thing is usless",1
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"A decent product, but as mattresses in the US seem to be quite high, I was surprised to see that it only came up a little over each side of the mattress i.e. less than I would have liked. EIther way it seems to do what it was intended for, which is all tha matters.",4
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"We have a regular pillow top mattress.  This set was not high enough for use with our mattress, coming only 2"" over the top of the mattress.Beyond that issue which caused us to return these, they are really great.  Easy to assemble and higher quality than a set we acquired two years ago.The picture of the rails is deceptive as the mattress in it must be only 5 or 6 inches high.  About half the thickness of our normal mattresses in the house.",3
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,My husband and I put this together in no time at all and our daughter used it last night for the first time. The best part is that the sides easily go down and under the mattress so her bed doesn't look like a hospital bed. Love this product!,5
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"I purchased this product because we were trasitioning our toddler to a twin bed.  She is an active sleeper so I needed secure double sided bed rails.  However, I also wanted the fold down rails to make changing the sheets easy.  The only good thing I can say about this product is that my child hasn't fallen out of bed yet.  It was a natural pain to put together, with much time and swearing involved.  I don't feel like it holds that securely to the mattress.  I'm constantly tightening them to the mattress.  The absolute worst part, is the folding down feature!  The MAIN reason I bought this particular product!!!!  The locking mechanism is a natural pain in the ass!  It's almost impossible to use.  I hoped it would get easier over time, but no such luck.  Every time I change the sheets, I want to rip the thing apart with my bare hands.  AND it's already torn 2 of our mattress pad covers because they catch on the metal clasps that hold it to the mattress.  I hate these rails and wouldn't recommend them to anyone.",1
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,Very poor design. Bars lift mattress at head and foot by about 2 inches leaving center of mattress to sag.  This will eventually ruin the mattress and it makes sleeping uncomfortable.  I realize that the bars need to be that thick to that the hidaway function will work properly but its just not worth it.  We installed it and then took it off as soon as we saw how it lifted the mattress.,1
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"We had a twin size bed from Ikea where it is kind of like a wood box where the mattress fits in.  And the bed rail does not sit nicely inside because it sticks out on the side.  As a result, the wooden slates keeps falling out of place.  I imagine this would fit better with the mattress box where nothing is surrounding the mattress.Otherwise it does protect the kid and it is long.  Price is not bad.",3
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,Have not used this with my toddler grandchildren yet however we felt the instructions for assembly we a little lacking-once we got it assembled under the mattress it seemed to function ok.  It is rather deep so I feel like the mattress might be tetering on the guide rails.  I will probably remove and store when the grandchildren are not visiting.,4
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"After reading some of the reviews I thought I was going to need to brush up on my calculus to install the rail.Its actually pretty easy. The only &#34;trick&#34; is how the straps are configured. Originally I accidently put the straps on the same side instead of across, from rail to rail. It was very easy to detach the straps and reposition. It took, maybe, 20 minutes to properly install it.After installing under the mattress, I put my full, grown man body weight against the rail and it held surprisingly well. It didn't really budge at all. I'm very confident that my kid that weighs about 10% of my body weight will stay put in bed at night with these in place.",5
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"Got the rails to go on the bed in our guest room so our grandson could spend the night with us.  The product works to keep him from falling out of bed, but they were not as easily put together as the instructions indictated.  The holes were off on one side and it is difficult to slide one side in under the mattress because the rails don't line up 100%",3
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"I'm sure this is a fine product to keep people from falling out of bed.  The 1 star is due to the description never mentioning, both online and on the box, that you MUST have a box spring for this to fit correctly.  I did not try it without a box spring on my son's platform bed because I want to follow the manufacturer's instructions.  This is, after all, about child safety.",1
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,I went to target to buy bed rails and they wanted $40 for ONE! This is by far the best price I've seen. And they work really well.,5
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"Very unhappy with this set of bed rails1)  Pins are tough to get into place- have to wiggle around the rail to get them in2)  Metal bent with normal everyday use - had to bend back with pliers and it doesn't work quite right anymore3)  Short rails (height)- only have a standard mattress, no pillow top or anything, but the rails aren't very high above it4)  Took a long time to put together.",1
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,Used it on our sons full size bed.  Relatively easy and quick assembly.  It's a little bit of a pain when you have to change the sheets bc you have to reposition it evenly under the mattress each time but I imagine that's the case with all bed rails.  Please given the price and the double rails. I haven't hidden the rails so I can't speak to that.,4
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"My baby likes to roll around and play on the bed with us, I breastfeed laying down, so these rails come in really handy to prevent falls. They are made quite sturdy, super easy to put together and put away. We will be using this for a while.",5
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,Does the job and makes me feel safe having my daughter in bed. Daughter rolls around and this is perfect.  I would recommend!,5
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"Great product, however, it definitely took an hour + to assemble. The rails will not hideaway on the type of bed frame we have for our daughter. Lastly, making the bed is pretty difficult, there is not enough room on the sides to lay the comforter down so we have to kind of tuck it under.",3
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,These are the first bedrails that we have tried for our 2 year old who converted from crib to twin bed. She has been in her &#34;big girl&#34; bed for about a month now with these bed rails and we have not had any issues at all. They prevent my toddler from falling out of bed and feel very secure to give mommy and daddy piece of mind. I would highly recommended these bed rails. These rails claim that you can &#34;hide them&#34; however we have never tried that as well just leave them up all of the time.,5
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"I bought this for my son's twin size bed.  My husband had it set up in less than 30 minutes.  They work great.  Very sturdy.  I love that I can just fold them down and slide under the mattress to make his bed during the day.  Sometimes the pins you pull to release the rail will get stuck, but not a big issue.  Just make sure they are turned the right way to fit inside the tube and it folds fine.  If I needed more rails for a second child, I would buy these again without question.  I highly recommend them!",5
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"Excellent buy, as I thought.I bought for my son who is 2 years old and will stay perfect to bed.I recommend it!",5
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,I bought this for my 5 year-old grandson for when he sleeps at my house and it works great.  I would recommend it to anyone.,5
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,These are easy to put together and use.  I wish they were a little less cumbersome so that they could travel easier.,5
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,Great for the money. Worked as advertised. I had these rails up for my two year old for a year and a half.,5
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,I use this on my daughter's full sized bed and it's great. It doesn't budge AT ALL! Her mattress is pretty tall and the rails do a great job of providing enough protection. I highly recommend this product!,5
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"This bed rail is difficult to put together. The pieces feel flimsy and cheap, AND it arrived filthy. I didn't buy it used - it was brand new. All of the parts were covered in some kind of red rust-like dirt. I would absolutely recommend purchasing a different brand.",1
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"This product is functional as advertised.  However, it's more difficult to install than I expected, also can't be used with one side only.  On the plus side, it's very heavy and secure when installed properly.",3
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"These rails work well, and as described.  They are a bit of a pain to take on/off, but once you get them on that shouldn't be a huge issue.",4
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"So, you can't go wrong on the price.  I looked at TRU/BRU and for the same ""ish"" thing - it was going to be double.  They are a pain to put together, my husband wasn't too happy.  We used it on a newer ""plush"" deeper fitting queen mattress.  The mattress comes up mid-way on the rails, so it's not the same as it's pictured.  I am not sure that we will ever be able to figure out how to collapse the sides to ""make the bed easier.""  I am just careful to tuck the bedding without catching it on the hinges.  It's not the best product, but for the price, I'll take the few drawbacks.",4
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"I love this product.  It is worth the money I spent and the wait (it was on back order).  In the past, I purchased a bed-rail from Summertime.  It was not a hide-away.  I had a hard time changing the bedding, and after awhile, my son kept hanging on it until it broke.  So, when my daughter needed a bed-rail for her bed, there was nothing to pass down and I bought the same product.  After researching alternatives, I found this product and I love it.  I returned the other product and am looking forward to passing this bed-rail down to my second daughter.  Also, the only reason I can not give 5 stars is that the knobs stick a little when hiding the rail, but this is nothing when you have the comfort of being able to change the bed without having to totally disassemble the bed-rail!",4
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,Works very well for our 2 year old.  Rails are surprisingly sturdy.  I was able to lift a queen size mattress by holding the rails.  Recommend getting a second person to help install.But even alone I assembled and put on the bed in less than 30 minutes.Grandma and grampa slept on the bed with the rails hidden and didn't even notice they were there.,4
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"Going on 6 months of daily use on a twin bed by a 3-year old boy without any falls.I don't use the slide-in feature much, but when I do it works fine.Strap adjustment underneath takes some fine tuning to find the balance between snug fit and being able to get the blankets tucked in.Was a little worried that the cloth sides wouldn't hold up, but there hasn't been any problem.The construction is sturdy enough to handle being climbed over several time, and on the 1 occasion when that resulted in a bent hinge/locking bracket, the metal was easily straightened with a pair of pliers.",4
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"We liked that this was a single unit that had rails for both sides. Assembly was slightly more complicated than expected, but still took under 15 minutes. It has worked as advertised, and we have been pleased with the product.",4
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,Loved the hide away feature. They were easy to assemble and served the purpose well. Was concerned with lumps left from tracks located under the mattress but it doesn't seem to be an issue. You should plan to elevate the mattress in some way to free the  tracks for easy sliding under the mattress. Should also plan on way to protect mattress from damage. This is only for when the grandkids visit so it won't be a big issue for me.,4
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"This is definitely one of the better options for a double-sided bed rail. However, the installation instructions were a bit odd and it took a while to get it secure enough that I felt safe with my toddler in it. So far it's done the job perfectly!",3
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,We have not used this bed rail much as it is on a spare bed but it seems sturdy and we have not identified any problems with it so far.I do want to commend Regalo on their customre service.  One of the spring loaded tabs that hold the rail in an upright position was not working right when we put the rails together.  I emailed the company and received a respone within 2 hours.  I explained the issue and they asked which part was defective and sent out a replacement.  The newpart snapped right into place and is working perfectly.The ease with which we got the replacement part was refreshing in an era where I have come to expect bad customer service.  I would certainly purchase from Regalo again.,4
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"These rails are a great deal for the price. A lot of the rails I was looking at were single rails and cost almost twice as much, so this was the perfect deal since I had to buy two sets. Like other reviewers mentioned, this can be tedious to put together. Once I had the first set put together, the second set was MUCH easier. The bar that fits in horizontally across the bottom of the rail is tough to put in. It took quite a bit of manuevering to get it in position, but at least I know it's definitely not going anywhere! I really do appreciate the hide away feature, since it will make changing sheets much easier and will allow guests to sleep in the beds without feeling like a toddler :) My only complaint is that the rails that fit in between the mattress and the boxspring are very thick. We had quite a big gap between the mattress and boxspring and I was worried that it was going to damage the bed springs. We just purchased the mattresses, so maybe I'm just overreacting. We ended up putting a few thick text books under the mattress (at the foot and head) so that the pressure was more even. Since my kids are both under 4, I don't imagine they could do much damage, but we have guests over quite a bit and I know I won't always have a chance to remove the rails. In the meantime, the books seem to do the trick and make the mattress quite a bit more even (you definitely couldn't feel the uneveness, I just knew it was there).",3
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"I like this product. It keeps out little girl in her bed, as she's a wild sleeper. It was easy to put together. I love that the sides fold down so that changing the bedding is easier.",4
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,This very good quality bed rail. It took me 15 minute to assemble without even looking the instructions. It is long enogh and strong enough even for an adult. My daughter love it.,5
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"The concept of this product is a nice one. But stay away unless you are a Texas A & M Mechanical Engineer graduate. Poor directions and very difficult to to put together. You will need a good work bench with clamps to even begin to be successful in the process. Or, at least a lot of time to devote to the project. Some things are just not worth the hassle.",2
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"Bought it for 4 yrs old. We went on vacation and I wanted to make sure she would be fine sleepng in a queen bed. Worked great!The only things, was to put it together took a while, no very easy... but either that, the rail is great!",5
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"Give yourself some time to put it together...maybe 30 minutes or so.  And it would be helpful to have a strong second person nearby to help with some of the construction.  But the rails look great, and fold under as described.  Now, I have not slept on the mattress with the rails hidden underneath, so I cannot speak to the comfort of the bed in that state...  I feel safe sleeping with my infant at my in-laws with these rails up.",5
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"Overall this is a good buy. The only bad thing that I found about this was that, it was sratchng and damaging the underside of my sons bunk bed due to its metal construction. I had to put my own padding between the elbow of this side rail and my sons bed to prevent further damage.",4
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"This product works on my son's full sized bed, however, the drop down sides do not work as well as I had hoped they would, in fact, it's very difficult to make the bed with this on, but I manage!",3
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,Fantastic product. We could not get the product in our country & with our 2 year old moving to her own bed was concerning.If you are in the same position this product is for you,4
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"I bought this product based on the reviews I read here.  It was a good decision, thanks to all who reviewed it.  The directions are a little ambiguous, but the design is simple and it's easy to put together.  Very sturdy and secure on bed.  Definitely buy the pair for the money rather than just one.",5
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"I looked at this set of rails and another one. What made me buy the other one was the information included the bed sizes the rails would work with!If you want to sell me a product, please make sure all the info I need is there! This is one piece I needed as I am putting this on my 5 year olds double bed.",2
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,The sides are easy to clip into place as well as take down when needed. I tried once or twice to hide one of the sides underneath the mattress but it took some effort to get it under under the bed.,4
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"I read all the reviews about the plastic clip breaking. Several people said they were able to tie it together to overcome the issue. This was the one rail that had all the features I was looking for and I'm resourceful so I figured I'd give it a try. The plastic clip broke immediately while assembling. I tied it but then lost the ability to slide it under the mattress while not in use. I sent an email to customer service who replied in less than 24 hours to give them the detail, ie, model# and part#, and they sent a replacement part that arrived in a couple days. My 20 month old granddaughter is much safer climbing out of the bed than she was hoisting herself over the rail of the crib, so I am pleased. I did add a cushioned storage chest at the bottom of the bed so it is even safer/easier for her climbing in/out. She always liked playing in her crib with books and toys. Now she takes her books and toys on her bed and still gets that comfort feeling without the danger of a long drop to the floor when she gets out. Regalo's customer service was very attentive and reactive to the problem with the clip. And I never had to call and sit on hold. And, as is so often the case, I wasted a lot of time shopping for the best price, only to come back to Amazon to order it. And No, I don't work for either Regalo or Amazon. :-)",4

Bugaboo Carseat Adapter - Cameleon and Frog - Maxi Cosi,"The product works properly, however the manner in which the instructions manual guides you through the installation process is incorrect.",4
Bugaboo Carseat Adapter - Cameleon and Frog - Maxi Cosi,"Ordered the adapters for the maxi cosi carseat. Tried them in this morning at 9 shipped thewm back at 10. Very difficult to align the car seat and very difficult to remove. Tried to reverse the right and left side thinking that was the problem, but then the entire angulation of the seat was off and it was no easier to remove. Ordered a kolcraft stroller / snap and go, for $15 more. Realized that adapters were way too expensive anyhow.",1
Bugaboo Carseat Adapter - Cameleon and Frog - Maxi Cosi,"These were great when my daughter was still in a car capsule as we didn't need to drag the bassinet of our Bugaboo everywhere, especially for quick trips to the shops. You have to be very careful putting them on as the 'left' and 'right' are when standing behind the pram.",5
Bugaboo Frog Parasol Color: Red,"we have a frog with ALL the accessories and love the stroller. but this product isn't a very useful accessory as it's not big enough to cover the child if you're moving around. it looks cute if you're stationary as it matches the stroller, but we keep this in storage.",2
Tiny Love Safari Fun Mobile,I bought this for my newborn who hates riding in the car.  I wanted some type of distraction for him.  This did not work all it does is bounce with the car and it is not easy to put on the headrest.  He didn't like it.  Maybe if it had music or lights that would have helped.  So I say save your money and try to find something else.,1
Cargo Cutie Gold Diva Diaper Bag,I feel like Kimora Lee Simmons with this diaper bag.  Of course I only use it when I am not needing a super practical bag.  Dont mind paying the $40 bucks to feel a little glammy.,4
Dr. Brown's Drying Rack,"As other reviews have said, this won't hold glass bottles at all, it is not great with 8 oz. plastic bottles, the bottom shelf is very difficult to reach (you have to unstack it to load/unload, which makes all the stuff on the top fall), and it has very little airflow, so things stay wet.Dr. Brown's just wanted to make a little more $ so they put their name on a product that is not all that great.",2
Dr. Brown's Drying Rack,"We already had a tree-like drying rack which is great, but once I cleaned all my pump equipment I had no room for any bottle equipment.  Enter this drying rack and I have my counter top back.",5
Dr. Brown's Drying Rack,i've been using this rack for the last 2 years and so far it's holding up.  i used one rack for glass bottles and the other for medela pump parts. i never used this stacked as it takes longer to dry the items on the bottle level.  i wanted a big rack so that my pump accessories would dry well. This allows me to spread out everything. It does take up a lot of room but at least everything dries.  You can have the water drain out or switch around so that the water collects in the tray.  I don't like water getting on the counter so i always have it collecting in the tray and I manually dump the water out every few days.,4
Dr. Brown's Drying Rack,This may be the most used item we have since having the baby ... other than the bottles themselves or a changing pad.  Love it.,5
Dr. Brown's Drying Rack,"I had a different brand name rack prior to this that broke.  This rack offers more drying capacity, is very sturdy and you have the option to dry side by side or stack the racks.  Excellent quality and I would highly recommend it to anyone.",5
Dr. Brown's Drying Rack,"I have the glass bottles, which I love, but I definitely can't stack the racks with them and the racks aren't very sturdy, even side by side.",3
Dr. Brown's Drying Rack,"While this product is made by the very reputable and high-end baby bottle maker, Dr. Brown's, I am dissapointed at the design. The two tier design makes it challenging to fit things underneath and then even more so, to find them easily when you need them. I would have rather had a one-tier design that was slightly larger. The two tier looks substanial on your counter, so keep that in mind if you have limited counter space. In this case, now that I have the product, it is not necessary to have the Dr. Brown's version to dry your Dr. Brown's bottles and accessories. I also bought this not having seen it at the store first. Would recommend finding one you like at the store and then shopping for it cheaper on the internet. As far as the Dr. Brown's bottle system...you can't beat them.",3
Dr. Brown's Drying Rack,I only use one tier of the rack though which holds maybe 6 bottles with all the necessities at a time.,4
Dr. Brown's Drying Rack,"its not that effective as it looks in the photo , i have trouble arranging the bottles,etc , not a good buy.",3
Dr. Brown's Drying Rack,Drying rack was easy to set up and use. It is also easy to clean and doesn't take up too much space on the counter.,5
Dr. Brown's Drying Rack,"there's lots of space for all your parts.  i don't stack these, so there's more space for drying items.  it is worth it!",5
Dr. Brown's Drying Rack,If you are wondering if you will like this product then I promise you will!  It works perfectly for the Dr. Browns bottles...but would work with ANY bottles.  Love the slight slant to let water run off and the system lets the bottles air dry well.  Easy to put together and wonderful to use!  If you buy this you will not be disappointed!,5
Dr. Brown's Drying Rack,It's perfect for Dr. Brown's bottles.  I use each rack individually otherwise it doesn't hold too many bottles but what rack does.I give it a five because I love Dr. Brown's products.,5
Dr. Brown's Drying Rack,Love this rack saves space and creates organization (big pieces one place & smaller ones in another) instead of having everything sprawled out!,4
Dr. Brown's Drying Rack,"si tienes un bebe solamente es como muy grande, porque casi nunca tienes lavando 8 teteros al mismo tiempo! al final decidimos quedarnos con una sola bandeja y guardar la otra para en una oportunidad posterior darsela como regalo a alguien!",3
Dr. Brown's Drying Rack,I love it! It really does come in handy. It doesn't take to much space so it's perfect fit small kitchens,5
Dr. Brown's Drying Rack,Two levels and lots of nooks and crannies for putting all the pieces of kids' bottles. There are multiple cylinders you can use to keep things upright for drying.,4
Dr. Brown's Drying Rack,"If you're using Dr Brown's bottles, you already know it is a 5 part bottle, 6 if you count the bottle cap, which I use on every bottle, to keep the nipple clean after I assemble them for use.Not to mention part # 7 the bottle cap which I also use!So you can imagine cleaning one bottle after use means I'm drying 7 parts!  The rack itself is great, but definitely does not accommodate all of the parts I have to wash and dry! Still I don't think any other rack would have come close to what I need with the dr. brown's bottles.  Because there are so many parts, I honestly don't know what would be better!  (That's not my job!)  But I do wish there was a better organizational way of drying all the parts.  Because it serves its purpose I rate it 4 stars... because it does not take into account all the parts I have to dry. I take one star away.",4
Dr. Brown's Drying Rack,"We ended up not keeping this drying rack or the Dr. Brown's bottles. The rack was not easy to fill, the bottles tipped over easily on top. The bottles have great reviews but cleaning out that little straw inside at 2am not our cup of tea. Our baby preferred another brand. We have friends who have been very happy with these but we personally were not.",2
Dr. Brown's Drying Rack,"As a fan of Dr. Brown's bottles, this drying rack seemed to be the perfect solution for our drying needs.It does fit all of the parts for 12 standard bottles (but only 8 wide-neck bottles). It can be stacked, but it might be a pain to get the parts from the bottom if you need them in a hurry, especially if you have those tall 8 oz. bottles on the top, since they tip so readily. However, if time is not of the essence, it is easy to simply take the rack back apart, or keep the two racks separate. (Surprisingly, this doesn't take up a whole lot of space.)The best thing I like about this rack is that it keeps all the small parts in a place where they won't fall in the cracks of the rack, which was a problem before we got this rack.What I don't like is that, like many other reviewers pointed out, the insides of the bottle take a VERY long time to dry out. Like, over 12 hours to dry after I used theDr. Brown's Electric Steam Sterilizer. I even shook as much moisture out as I could before I put the bottles on the rack. What's up with that? Interestingly, when my husband hand-washed the bottles and put them on the rack, they dried significantly faster.However, since we have a lot of bottles (thus affording us a little extra time to let a few bottles dry), this rack was great, since the parts are all in a nice place until they do dry. The rectangular shape of the rack minimizing the space-wasting. (As opposed to the round drying racks. Too much wasted space.) Honestly, even with the little flaws, I do absolutely love this thing.NB: I use the standard plastic bottles. I'm not sure how well this works with the glass bottles, or the wide-neck bottles.",4
Dr. Brown's Drying Rack,"I love this rack, there are so many parts that go with the dr browns bottles, they roll everywhere when drying them after cleaning, this rack keeps them in place and nothing gets lost, highly recommend.",5
Dr. Brown's Drying Rack,"Overall the rack is ok but there are definitely some design flaws. The rack is a 2-tier rack, but the problem is that unless you take it apart to use the lower tier the number of items you can place in there to dry is limited because you cannot just push the smaller items to the middle because of the parts that stick up. The rack also doesn't hold glass bottles as sturdily as it does plastic, probably because of the weight differential. I was hoping for more with this.",3
Sesame Beginnings 2-In-1 Activity Center,"My daughter loves this activity center...there are days when she will spend over an hour in it at a time. I will warn you that it takes a lot of force to assemble this toy, but it's worth it...and that's added peace of mind you'll have knowing your baby is not strong enough to pull anything off and hurt themselves with it. We have yet to use it as a walker.",5
Cargo Cutie Modern Mom Cream Diaper Bag,This item is both servicable and chic.  Large enough with compartments needed to handled baby's and mother's needs.  Lightweight and easy to clean.,5
Cargo Cutie Modern Mom Cream Diaper Bag,After only 1 month of use the purse fell apart the material just crumbled off always had it all over my clothes and I couldnt understand why I was very careful with it and I actually had to buy me a new diaper bag needless to say i will not be  purchasing anything else from this seller,2
Cargo Cutie Modern Mom Cream Diaper Bag,It's a nice looking diaper bag that isn't covered with silly cartoons and looks more like a purse. But the quality of the bag is terrible. The back part of the bag started to peel and then the front pockets. I threw it away a before I'd had it for a month.,1

Safety 1st Tot-Lok Deluxe Starter Kit,"I have a very curious 2 year old puppy who spends the day trying to get into the cabinets.  I've tried many different types of cabinet locks - and this is by far the best one on the market.  I'm confident that the dog won't be able to open these no matter how hard he tries!  Installation was a breeze.  The first one probably took 20 minutes by the time I figured out the directions and learned the process, but once you get the one done the others are super quick and easy.  The directions aren't as bad as some reviews would lead you to believe.  Honestly how many instruction manual have you found easy to read - compared to a lot of other ones I've read this one is pretty straight forward.",5
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Deluxe Starter Kit,"This product is a bit of a challenge to install but stick with it because once installed, it really works!",4
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Deluxe Starter Kit,"I installed these on cupboards and drawers where there were items that could hurt a dementia patient. He tries the door or drawer and walks away and says must be locked for safety.  They do not show, therefore there is nothing for him to play with.  Now I just need to be able to buy more with another key.",5
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Deluxe Starter Kit,"The magnetic safety tot lock is by and far the best tot lock on the market. It works by installing a magnetic lock on the back side of the cabinet door, this lock keeps the door from opening at all so there is no chance that your child will accidentally figure out how to open it. There is no practical way your child will be able to open the cabinets without the magnetic key. In fact I would recommend getting a second key in case you lose your first one as there is really no way for an adult to open the lock without the key, normal magnets found in children's toys and on the refrigerator will not work. That being said the installation can be a little difficult but should be no problem if following the template and using proper tools.",5
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Deluxe Starter Kit,"the locks work very fine, our toddler has not been able to open the cabinets",5
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Deluxe Starter Kit,"We purchased these Tot-Locks about three years ago and when our little one was a year old and it has yet to be defeated (most other child safety products have long since been conquered).  Despite the investment in time (installation) and money, this product is well worth it for the piece of mind. The locks we've realized will never have to be removed.  When we no longer need them, we can just flip the lever to unlock them (see ""con"" below).  If we ever resell the house, we figure the cabinet locks will actually add value for parents or grandparents of small children.The only cautions: (1) buy one or two extra ""keys"" because somehow we have lost a couple (locked in cabinets??) (2) check after teenagers' cabinets and cabinets used by cleaning help to make sure the locks have not been disengaged.",5
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Deluxe Starter Kit,"So far I only used these locks for about a week for my kitchen cabinets and I love how they work.  The best part is that there is an option to shut the locks off for a while and turn them back on with just a flip of the little red lever.  It comes in very handy when the baby is not around and I need to cook, clean or do other tasks that require frequent opening and closing of cabinets.",5
Safety 1st Tot-Lok Lock - Set of 4,These locks are not the locks in the picture. They are the bulkier and harder to put on.  The screws that come with them are difficult to install in my cabinets because they are a weird size and broke my cabinet door.  Not very happy!!! had to pre drill holes and still were hard to install.  Do not buy these!!!! Buy the 2 lock ones with the lock.  They look like the ones in the picture.,1
"Lambs &amp; Ivy Hello Kitty Blanket, Pink Polka Dot","I bought this when I got my daughters new Hello Kitty bedroom set. I planned to stick it at the bottom of her twin be to add a little color. I was to small to fold over once and lay at the end of the bed like I had planned but it was still a very cute blanket that my 2yr. loves and uses to cover herself and her dolls with.

Safety 1st Outlet Cover with Cord Shortener,Does the job. Completely kid proof probably even for our 5 year old. It would be tough to pull off with weak or injured hands though. Will buy another.,5
Safety 1st Outlet Cover with Cord Shortener,not as easy to install as it should be for a baby product...it took 2 of us to install it (not simultaneouslyy),3
Safety 1st Outlet Cover with Cord Shortener,"These work well. The toddlers room needed to be toddler proofed, and we used these for the outlets in his room since like most toddlers, he's fascinated by outlets. The cord shortener is great. I'm not tripping over cords and he can't strangle himself.",5
Safety 1st Outlet Cover with Cord Shortener,"I purchased several of these outlet covers because I thought the cord shortener would be a handy option to have.  I was first kind of disappointed when I took it out of the box and realized it was not a hinged cover, but one that comes all the way off.  The cover snaps on to the switchplate section over two plastic pieces that snap through holes on either side of the cover.  You then squeeze them both to release the cover. Not really a one-handed operation.I then tried to use it to cover the outlet for our television and found that the cords won't come out of the cover properly unless you wind them up on the cord shortener, so using the shortener wasn't optional after all.  It absolutely did not work with the thick television power cord.  This cover seems very limited in only being able to tackle long, very flexible cords.  Am returning all of them in favor of a better design.",2
Safety 1st Outlet Cover with Cord Shortener,"I agree with Genevieve Gibson, I have two girls toddler, and neither one have an interest in sticking their fingers in the electrical outlets, but definitely they like to pull plugs, specially the TV. This protector is a great idea, its very secure, its strudy and there is no way my daughters can open it to unplug the cables.",5
Safety 1st Outlet Cover with Cord Shortener,My 1-year old was able to remove this cover 2 minutes after the first installation.  It does not work (at least for me).... waste of money.,1
Safety 1st Outlet Cover with Cord Shortener,"This is great, if you have anything such as a floor lamp that you want plugged in all the time you need one of these, once plugged in the kid cannot get to the cords or even damage the prongs as the cord loops inside.  A great buy.",5
Safety 1st Outlet Cover with Cord Shortener,"My son doesn't have an interest in trying to stick his finger into the socket but he certainly likes to pull plugs. I was spending half of the day trying to keep him away from all of the outlets. These outlet covers have solved the problem. I can get to things if need be but he can't. They are easy to put on and remove with a minimum of fuss. I am tempted to give these as gifts to other new parents. Inexpensive, simple and safe.",4
Safety 1st Outlet Cover with Cord Shortener,To make long story short - I was looking for something that would give me the possibility to use the A/C outlet but will protect my child in parallel. This product does what is excepted to do. My child now can play in his room alone!!!,5
Safety 1st Outlet Cover with Cord Shortener,Love these things keep little babies from messing with cords and I don't have to worry they are going to electrocute themselves,5
Safety 1st Outlet Cover with Cord Shortener,"The cover is fine in and of itself.  The description wasn't specific so I was hoping that it might work over the larger plugs and thick power cords, the plug part is fine, but the cover won't clip on when the cord itself is a thicker gauge.  I feel like I could have gotten cheaper covers to do the same thing and I'm still searching for covers that work for thicker cords.  Nonetheless the cover itself and for what it's designed for it works perfect.  Installation was easy and took just a few minutes.  The cover looks good and does what it's supposed to, hence the 4 stars.",4
Safety 1st Outlet Cover with Cord Shortener,This is great product if you have children in your house. It can also be use for adults who don't have any safety awareness.,5
Safety 1st Outlet Cover with Cord Shortener,This would work great if it was meant for thicker wires. I wanted to use it for a power strip. Those cords are not huge but they are a little thick and wont fit through the slot. It might have the cord sizes listed. Not sure.,3
Safety 1st Outlet Cover with Cord Shortener,"LOVE THIS! We have two, one upstairs and one in the downstairs playroom. Perfect to protect your items from being unplugged by a curious toddler. Safety 1st quality, and a great deal.",5
Safety 1st Outlet Cover with Cord Shortener,"I purchased this product to keep my curious 16-month-old daughter from pulling plugs out of the outlets... and it works like a charm. It was very easy to install. I have them all over the house! I highly recommend, as it's one less thing you, as a parent, need to worry about.",4
Safety 1st Outlet Cover with Cord Shortener,"We have an outlet that it seemed our baby was attracted to.  When he started crawling he would immediately go over to it and try to pull on the cords.  We always had our phone charger and other things plugged in there and didn't have any other place in the room to put them, so we were constantly having to steer him away from them.  This protects them and yet gives us the flexibility of using them when we need to without having to remove them every time we needed to keep him from getting into them.This product is definitely worth the money.",5
Safety 1st Outlet Cover with Cord Shortener,"Before I installed these covers, my little guy was constantly trying to get to the outlets, which were covered with those little clear plastic covers.  He was obsessed with trying to get the covers off.  But once I installed the Safety 1st covers, he stays away. He's not interested at all and just walks on by.  The Safety 1st cover fits all of the outlets in my house, no problem.  And I like the fact that it's kind-of difficult to remove the cover - makes me feel safer that my little guy could never get it off.",5
Safety 1st Outlet Cover with Cord Shortener,"Just like others have said, if you have things plugged in to the outlet you are trying to cover that have thick cords, this isn't going to work without some adjustment.  Luckily, my husband was able to make the holes at the bottom bigger with some cutting (and since the plastic is sort of flexible, the unit did not crack).  I hate having to do things like this to make it work, but all the oulet covers are the same way.  It isn't the most attractive thing in the world, but I guess that really isn't the point.  Once we got the adjustments made and got used to looking at it, it worked.  My son can't pull the plugs out now, although he does still try to pull the cords at the bottom- but the electrical hazard is much less now.",3
Safety 1st Outlet Cover with Cord Shortener,"This works great for most everything you'll need to plug in.  It is not intended to cover something with an  adapter, so if you want this flexibility, I would suggest purchasing a different product.  I like that it helps keep cords short and out of the way.",5
Safety 1st Outlet Cover with Cord Shortener,We bought these because our toddlers are fascinated with outlets and plugs. Fits great and they don't bother with them anymore :),5
Safety 1st Outlet Cover with Cord Shortener,"At first, I was quite pleased with this purchase.  The unit was easy to install and was securely in place to the point where I was confident that my 9 month old son wouldn't be able to defeat it.  AND THEN... I plugged in an electrical cord, and replaced the outlet cover.  I gave only a SLIGHT tug on the cord (like my son often does when he gets a cord in his hands), and the cover POPPED OFF in less than a second.I will be returning the 3 units that we purchased.  (I've bought 100+ items on Amazon.  This will be my first return!)We also bought the 'Mommy's Helper' plate covers (the ones that slide shut when a cord is removed) and they work FABULOUSLY!

Munchkin Fresh Food Feeder,Love this item. I freeze fruit and put it in so it serves two purposes.. helps with teething and is a nice little snack. He loves frozen ripe pears the most so far. I have put frozen peas which he likes too.Cleaning is my biggest issue too. Wish I could put it in the sterilizer but it says not to. It would probably melt the mesh. Since it is so cheap I think Ill buy a few more of them.My little guy loves feeding himself and this is perfect. I would give it 5 stars if it wasnt for the cleaning issue.,4
Munchkin Fresh Food Feeder,This product is impossible to wash and actually get cleaned.  I couldn't get the food pieces out to save my life. I tried scrubbing them out and even washed it in the dishwasher as it suggests.,3
Hands Free Breastpump Bra Halter One size fits most,"This bra is able to keep the pumps in place very well, but the velcro gets stuck on everything. I wish I would have got one with a zipper instead.",3
Hands Free Breastpump Bra Halter One size fits most,"My son was 9.5 pounds when he was born so needless to say, he was sleeping through the night quite early. Great for dad, not so great for mom. So when I'd have to get up at all hours of the morning to pump, a half groggy mom trying to hold two pumps isn't ideal. This product is wonderful. Like other people, I cut the neck strap off and it stays on just fine. I have the Medela pump in style bag and it works perfectly with the band. There's velcro on the band and all you need to do it open your bra (as if you were going to nurse) and you're good to go. The velcro makes it nice because as I'm losing weight, I can just adjust as needed. I was looking into the other ""hands-free"" devices out there and I definitely recommend the pumping band to anyone. Now I can read or play on the computer while pumping and it makes the time go by much more quickly.",5
Hands Free Breastpump Bra Halter One size fits most,"The pumping band was a life saver.  It allowed me to pump and use my laptop at the same time while I was in the office.  It took me a while to pump, so I'd never be able to get work done if I didn't have this.",5
Hands Free Breastpump Bra Halter One size fits most,"This product really does its job holding the flanges in place for the entire pumping session. It was nice to be able to do otherthings while pumping instead of just holding the bottles. This will be great once I go back to work and need to pump. My only complaints are that it takes long to put on, and that the Velcro edge are a bit rough and sharp.",4
Hands Free Breastpump Bra Halter One size fits most,"I got this as a first try at an easy/quick to use hands free system.  So far I have found it works great for me.  I am a large size (F/G cup), and the setup of the regular size out of the package only needed minor tweaking to fit me perfectly.  I have read other reviews where there were complaints about itchy velcro, but I have not experienced any issues with it.  I just try to take care when putting on the halter (have used with and without clothing underneath) and have not experienced any itchy issues.  The neck strap doesn't seem to be needed once I got comfortable with the halter itself and felt more assured that once it was in place it was not going to move, and trust me, once you start pumping it is not going anywhere!My only negative would be that the velcro is really good = read noisy.  My little one startles at the noise if I try to open the halter quickly to remove it.  I've simply adjusted my timing and open the velcro closure slowly to prevent scaring the heck out of him.I'm glad I didn't spend a ton of money for one of the more fitted bustier type hands free systems when this one works like a charm!",4
Hands Free Breastpump Bra Halter One size fits most,"I expected this product to be a basic piece of elastic after reading another teachers review.  Being a teacher I knew that I had to find a hands free way to pump in order to use my time effectively.  I am able to type and respond to parent emails, or well type and write this review on Amazon.  I even used this product on a field trip.  At first it was a bit difficult to put it on, but now I can put the elastic around my body within seconds.With many products on the market to hold flanges and offer &#34;hands free&#34; pumping, this one seems to be the most flexible.  In fact, I love that I can adjust the elastic, especially in the middle of the night or morning if my breasts are engorged, the elastic can be adjusted based on need.  I would highly recommend buying this product and avoiding trying to &#34;guess the right size&#34; on the other styles of hands free pumping support bras.",5
Hands Free Breastpump Bra Halter One size fits most,"I should have listened to the person who wrote the review that this product (""Halter Hands Free Breast Pump"")scratches your skin.  No matter how well you align it, there are edges that touch your skin that will scratch you.  I also do not like the tab that fastens to the neck strap because it binds to the strap across your chest before you can position the neck strap. TOO MUCH VELCRO! It's not as easy to adjust the first time you get it on.  I have a bad neck, so the strap around that area is very unpleasant for me and if it were not so thick, it may have been okay.  Save your money and time.",1
What to Expect The Toddler Years,"I've adopted a one year and a half boy and had no clue of what he needed or what I should do when encountering a dilemma. This book has answer to questions I didn't even think I had.  As it is divided in months, it makes you read all through it and making sure you're accessing your kid's needs at that particular age. It has been amazingly helpful. I just love it.",5
Double-Touch Plug 'N Outlet Covers - 2 pack,This barely allows the cord to fit through the opening and it is a standard size cord.  I would not buy again.,1
Double-Touch Plug 'N Outlet Covers - 2 pack,"These are hard to open, like a lot of reviewers said, but isn't that kind of the point? Getting them open in order to install them was very hard for me, I had to get my husband to do it for me, but once installed they're hard but not overly hard to open. I'm glad I bought these. My 11 month old is fascinated with unplugging the tv, so this will make life a lot safer for him, and easier for me.",4
Double-Touch Plug 'N Outlet Covers - 2 pack,"This product is has solid quality, but almost all the things I have plugged into my sockets would not work with this product.  The holes are too small for moderately thick cords and the depth of the casing is way too shallow.  Does not work with my air fan plug, baby monitor plug or IPOD dock plug.  Kind of pointless for using in a toddler's room as I'm sure many other people would be trying to cover up similar items.  Oh well....",2
Double-Touch Plug 'N Outlet Covers - 2 pack,"Super tight fit once it locks in place.  I use it with lamp cords, so I didn't have any problems making them fit inside.  My toddler can't get it off, and it's even difficult for me, which is a good sign.",5
Double-Touch Plug 'N Outlet Covers - 2 pack,These are fantastic if you have toddlers who are oh so interested in pulling plugs. They attach very nicely to our electrical sockets and could never be taken off by my son. Even I have to really try! They definitely do their job!,5
Double-Touch Plug 'N Outlet Covers - 2 pack,"I found this product worked very well in my situation.  We wanted to plug a lightweight extension cord into an outlet that is near my 2-year-old's crib for a few weeks for some Christmas lights in the hallway outside his room, and I was afraid he'd lay there in his crib and play with the cord.  With this on there, he can't get two hands in the right place to open the cover and pull the cord out.  I'm not going to say it's totally childproof or a permanent solution, but in this particular situation, it does the job.So I have pretty standard outlets with a single screw in the middle.  Installation took about 3 minutes, would have taken 2 minutes except I forgot to put the outlet cover plate back on the first time.  I find it easy enough to lift and close the cover, it takes fairly gentle squeeze from both sides simultaneously with lifting with the other hand.  Maybe a clever or determined child could figure it out but so far mine haven't even tried.This will not work for you if you have anything other than two outlets (top & bottom) with a screw in the middle with a standard thread (I think it's #6-32).  So if you live in an old vintage house with sideways outlets on the baseboards or whatever other non-standard configuration, this product will not work for you.  It will also not work for you if you're plugging in a large three-pronged straight-on plug or one of those big fat round heads, or a DC wall adapter, or any other sort of &#34;large&#34; plug.  It will be a problem with any heavy-duty cord that can't bend into a fairly tight radius.  This is fine if you're plugging in a basic lamp with a two-prong cord, or similar with a typical light-duty two-prong plug.  It would probably also work for a right-angle three-prong plug although those aren't so common.",4
Arm's Reach Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet - Natural,We bought this 3 years ago for our first born...then used it for our second child..and now bought it as a gift for a friend. It was wonderful to have our children so close while they were &lt;6 months of age. We initially lived in a house with a smallish master bedroom so the mini co-sleeper was perfect. We even brought it on trips with us because it folded up so easily.The only negative thing I have to even offer is that you should realize ahead of time that you have to scoot down some in order to be able to get out of your bed. Not a big deal to me--but it prevented one of my relatives from ordering it.Great product that has withstood the test of time!Highly recommended.,4
Arm's Reach Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet - Natural,for a babyshower to two beautiful friends who's nature is to expect only items of fine luqury quality.  I was pleased to find ouy and hear from them that it was def one of the most resourceful babyshower gifts and &#34;the best&#34;,5
Arm's Reach Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet - Natural,"I have been using the mini co-sleeper with my now 3 month daughter since we brought her home.  It works extremely well.  I love having her right by me.I had a c-section, and it was very useful when we first got home. My husband had to hand her to me since I couldn't lift her.  I can't imagine using anything else.  It is so convenient to have her right next to me at night.  Even though she is sleeping through the night, it is still nice having her next to me still.  I highly recommend this.",5
Arm's Reach Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet - Natural,"I loved having this co-sleeper for my newborn.  It is so nice to be able to reach over and get the baby to nurse without getting out of bed.  It is great if you have the baby in bed with you some and want a space for the baby also.Pros:Good size (unless you have a huge baby :) - my baby is now 7 months and 14 lbs and still fits inside just fine.Convenient for night nursingStraps to the bed, so no worries about baby falling between bed and bassinetCons:It is a bit hard to fold down/set up - don't buy it for travelThe sleep area for the baby does not lower (I think the large size one does), so this cannot be used as a playpen or with a baby that can pull upI am really glad we had this, and it is now on loan to another new mom until we have another baby.",5
Arm's Reach Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet - Natural,"While putting together this item, the top bars were not able to stay locked and clicked up amidst reading the directions and watching YouTube video tutorials a dozen times. I contacted Arm's Reach Co a week ago and have had no response.Luckily, Amazon was able to have the seller accept my return. If you have any problems with this item, make sure not to contact Arm's Reach Co. I have no idea why I even bothered buying another one.",1
Arm's Reach Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet - Natural,I bought this before our baby was born just because we could fit it with our bed. Luckily for our little queen bed its level was just at the right height for Mom to easily get to the child. For a normal King size bed with box spring this bassinet is wayyyy down.Also it is a pain to ""disassemble"". There are two joints in every horizontal ""pipe"". Although there are buttons that are supposed to make them loose. But typically one joint would get loose but other won't. I was relocating and I decided to took this bassinet with me for the baby during our stay in the hotel. It was a real struggle to get it to ""disassemble"".You can get cheaper ""pack n play"" that would be a lot more convenient than this.,3
Arm's Reach Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet - Natural,"I USED THIS PRODUCT (IN THE FERN COLOR) FOR BOTH OF MY GIRLS. MY FIRST DAUGHTER SLEPT IN IT UNTIL SHE WAS 7 MONTHS OLD AND MY SECOND DAUGHTER UNTIL SHE WAS NEARLY 9 MONTHS OLD. IT WAS A GOD SEND TO HAVE THEM SO CLOSE AT NIGHT SO I COULD EASILY REACH OVER TO PICK THEM UP TO NURSE. I THINK I GOT MUCH BETTER SLEEP THAN I WOULD HAVE IF THEY WERE ACROSS THE ROOM OR IN ANOTHER ROOM. I ALSO USED IT AS A MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT CHANGING TABLE. ITS SMALL SIZE EASILY FIT INTO OUR TINY BEDROOM. I ONLY WISH THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN USED AS PLAYPEN ALSO LIKE THE LARGER MODEL CAN. NOW THAT MY GIRLS HAVE OUTGROWN IT, THEY USE IT FOR THEIR DOLLS. IT'S STILL IN GREAT SHAPE AND COULD EASILY BE USED FOR SEVERAL MORE LITTLE ONES. IT IS SUCH A GREAT PRODUCT AND A FANTASTIC WAY TO HAVE YOUR BABY SAFELY SLEEP WITH YOU.",5
Arm's Reach Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet - Natural,Works well as a bassinet but didn't use the co-sleeper function.  Difficult to setup and take down but once assembled felt sturdy enough.  Only complaint is that it lacks 4 wheels so when moving you tend to scrap your legs/ankles against the non-wheel legs.,4
Arm's Reach Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet - Natural,"We absolutely LOVE the Arms Reach Mini Co-Sleeper!  We bought it for our third child and wish we had it for all our kids. I have nursed all my babies and this is a wonderful way to be close to baby all night, pull her into bed with you to nurse, and put her right back to sleep next to you in her own safe bed. It allowed me to get more sleep at night than I did with my other children without this product. It's great for the convenience, the size and the function.  You can use it attached to your bed or you can have it free standing away from the bed. It has a zipper compartment underneath that is great for storing blankets, diapers or clothes.  It also has some upper handy pockets for diapers and small items.  Also, since it has 2 wheels, you can easily take it to another room (for example if you want baby to nap (in early months) in the living room where you can keep a closer eye on her). It is recommended to use this only up to about 5 months of age.  At which time we purchased the Arms Reach Co-Sleeper Original (for our 4th child...wish we had that one for all our children too).  Although the Mini Co-Sleeper may seem a bit pricey, it is a fantastic product and worth every penny.  It is GREAT QUALITY.  I have even loaned it out twice and I have used it for 2 of my own.  It still feels brand new after 4 children using it!!!  It comes with 1 sheet, so you may want to order an extra sheet for spare!  Overall I give it 5 starS, no complaints!",5
Arm's Reach Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet - Natural,"One of the best ""baby"" purchases we've made. Our LO is almost 6 months old now, so it is time to move her to the nursery. The co-sleeper made life much easier for us.",5
Arm's Reach Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet - Natural,I bought this in '09 for use with my youngest daughter- now 4 years old.  I gave it to my niece once we were done with it.  She and her hubby have used it with their now 2.5 year old son and now with their new one month old son.....Three babies have enjoyed this one piece of furniture.  Both of us mothers  are satisfied.  Co-sleeping worked so well for us!,5
Arm's Reach Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet - Natural,"This product is so wonderful!  As a breastfeeding mother, having my baby close is crucial.  This product has been a lifesaver, and I recommend it to all my friends.  My baby is 5 months and still in it, though she has started to move more so we'll have to transition soon.  Thank you Arm's Reach!",5
Arm's Reach Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet - Natural,"The Arm's Reach Mini Co-Sleeper does a great job of what it claims to do--provide a comfortable sleep place for baby--but the one real complaint I have is that it totally gets in the way. While one might argue that the nature of the beast makes this unavoidable, my wife was nonetheless surprised by just how difficult it was to get out of bed with the co-sleeper attached, especially if you have to put it in front of a bedside table.The other problem we've run into with the co-sleeper is that it's a bit more difficult to collapse than a standard Pack 'n' Play. This is also probably to be expected, given its diminutive size, but it surprised me that--even after having set it up personally--I still need to read the manual, each time I take it down for transport (e.g. when we spend the night somewhere).None of this is sufficient to drop the rating below four stars, though. While a Pack 'n' Play would be less expensive, the Co-Sleeper is much more compact. Overall, it's a great product, and our two-month-old son seems quite comfortable sleeping therein, even though it now stays at the foot of our bed instead of the side.",4
Arm's Reach Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet - Natural,"We wanted to co-sleep with our baby, but knew would sometimes not want her in our bed.  This co-sleeper is a nice compromise between a separate crib/bassinet and always having the baby in your bed.  It is so easy to reach over to soothe her, talk to her, or pick her up and bring her into bed or vice versa.  It also gives baby some practice sleeping on her own before we move her to a crib.",5
Arm's Reach Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet - Natural,"Our baby hated his crib, and as a consequence slept in our room/bed/bassinet for several months.  This co-sleeper was helpful for those first few months, but it always felt a little unstable.Pros:- Keep baby close by, makes it easy to breastfeed in those early weeks when baby wakes up every two hours.  I always felt more rested having him right there rather than getting up to get him- Baby slept better in the co-sleeper since he could always be touching me- Safer than baby sleeping in the bed with us.Cons:- Slightly unstable - this co-sleeper always felt like it would tip over easily if the dogs decided to get curious about it.  Also, one of the sides would rarely stay in the locked position- Co-sleeper mattress is about 4 inches below the side that connects to the bed.  This always made it harder to move baby into the bassinet if he fell asleep while breastfeeding, since you had to pick him up and lower him into the co-sleeper.- After the first few months, baby will outgrow it.  It is a lot of money to spend on something for 3 months.  However, at the time I don't know what I would have done without it.",3
Arm's Reach Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet - Natural,"Was it worth spending the extra money when baby would only use for 6 months or so? Heck yea! I would gladly spend any amount of money to make my life easier with a newborn and to get more sleep. I bought this because I wanted the baby in the room until he was ready to be in his real crib. It's nice to have baby close by so you can feed or tend to the baby's needs immediately.I didn't attach the sleeper to my bed because you can just easily keep it close to the bed with out it moving. It has wheels on it so it is very portable. I had it in the bedroom at night and rolled it into the living room during the day for the first 2 months of baby's life. I also didn't need the attachments to make it taller.It's a little tricky attaching a mobile because it doesn't have rails like a normal crib. But there is a little opening that enabled us to use two different types of mobiles at two different times. I have a Fischer price projection mobile that wouldn't stay up without some extra support. So, I put a sonicare toothbrush travel case between the base of the mobile and the co-sleeper rail. It's working out great! The hard firm plastic supports the mobile and there is no hazard to the baby.Keep in mind: The original co-sleeper can be used longer since it's bigger and converts into a play pen.I DON'T like:*The mattress is attached to the crib with Velcro. It's a pain in the butt to replace the sheet when the Velcro keepsattaching to the back of mattress as you try to put it back on.*The mattress is becoming uneven from use. Noticed this after about 2 months of use.*I noticed the material under the mattress is sagging (when mattress is taken off) from the baby's weight.I LIKE:*Portability, a little heavy but at least it rolls around.*Extra storage space underneath the crib*Easy access to baby at night*CompactScore: A",4
Arm's Reach Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet - Natural,"This co-sleeper is great quality and I like that it does not take lots of space. I like that you can attach it to the bed and the side bar goes down. I love the storage on the bottom and I would use it again when I have another child. My baby does not like it BUT that's because he does not want to sleep anywhere but our bed! Therefore, it's not the co-sleepers fault. Amazon had the best price and it was shipped quickly!",5
Arm's Reach Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet - Natural,"Our daughter is adopted and we didn't get much notice of her arrival.  So we quickly bought the co-sleeper after reading all the great reviews while we waited for her crib to be delivered.  We ended up also ordering the leg extensions (as our bed was too high for sleeper without them), and the canopy (as we have 2 cats and were not sure how they would react to her).  So it ended up being a pricey purchase.Pros: It does allow the baby to be right next to the bed.  Set-up is pretty easy.  Has wheels on one end so you can roll it like a wheelbarrow.  Fabric is soft.  Fur mattress cover is nice.  If you order directly from the Arms Reach website, there are more color options (which I discovered after we purchased the natural).  Canopy has a nice zipper feature to get the baby in and out.Cons: We couldn't use it as a co-sleeper without using all of the extensions.  The mobile that came with the canopy makes it hard to get the baby in and out of the zipper.  The canopy only works if you have all four sides up and are using it as a bassinet rather as a co-sleeper.  Taking it down was a bit more challenging than putting it up as the ""locks"" that you have to disable are located under fabric and were hard to find and press. It made getting in and out of bed challenging.We ended up using it more as a bassinet than a co-sleeper. We also didn't like it because I woke up with every gurgle, cough, coo, grunt, etc. that she made.  Granted, that could have just been new mom jitters, but it made for rough nights, especially since I'm not one to fall asleep quickly.  We ended up sleeping in shifts and that worked better for us.We bought a Graco Travel Lite Crib for use in another room during the day and liked it better than the co-sleeper.  No extensions needed, initial cost was cheaper, easier to break down, can be used as a crib as well as a bassinet, it's small, and the colors are cute.  Much better if you are on a budget.",2
Arm's Reach Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet - Natural,"Looks nice and fit well in our room. We had to buy the leg extensions as our bed is high; and actually took off the wheels for a bit when our daughter was having a lot of problems with reflux, so she slept on an incline. Love that we can travel with it, comes with a great cover. Mattress is firm, much firmer than her crib mattress. Love the pockets as well, kept extra blankets, wipes, burp rags etc in there.",5
Arm's Reach Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet - Natural,"This co-sleeper DOES NOT convert to a play pen. The 'product features' are misleading Arm's reach brand has a convertible mini but that was not what I received. Mine, just like one of the pictures show has a storage space underneath, but cannot be converted to playpen or a deep bassinet.",5
Arm's Reach Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet - Natural,"All I can say is I should have purchased the co-sleeper three kids ago.  This item wasn't available when I had my first 16 years ago, so we used a bassinet.  With my second baby 7 years ago, we assumed the bassinet would work fine, so that is what we used.  Well, he only slept 30-90 minutes at a time until 20 months of age, and let me tell you, we spent many restless nights getting up out of bed to get him from his bassinet or being kicked by his little feet!  Our third didn't sleep any better, and she ended up in our bed until age three - not a problem for mommy, but daddy is a light sleeper and was also missing his wife:)  Finally, when our fourth was born in December of '07, we used a bassinet for about 3 days; I fell asleep one night with her in my arms out of sheer exhaustion and woke up horrified to find her under our heavy down comforter and immediately rushed downstairs to order this co-sleeper.  I like all my friends are terrified of SIDS and since new research indicates infants in bed with mom and dad are actually at a higher risk, we couldn't in good concience, let her sleep in our bed like we did with our third.  She sleeps so soundly in her little co-sleeper nest. It is just the right size, and she can suck her paci and look at mommy until she drifts off.  It is so much better than a bassinet becasue I don't even have to sit up to tuck her paci back in her mouth or pat her to sooth her.  She is a bigger baby at 75% for height and weight, and she is showing no signs of outgrowing her co-sleeper.  I only wish I had had this with the last two, it would have made my nights much more pleasant!",5
Arm's Reach Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet - Natural,"We ordered this co-sleeper because we wanted to co-sleep with our newborn son but only have a queen size bed, making it uncomfortable for three of us to sleep together. This was a compromise. I had a c-section and despite what some reviews say, I actually loved having this post-op. I didn't even sleep in my bed (or recline for that matter) until 1 week post-op. So, this bassinet is portable and was placed by my recliner the whole week. Very comforting knowing my baby was next to me the entire time. The quality is the only thing I'm slightly disappointed in. The bed base actually feels like it slants downwards or sideways, allowing my son to roll if placed on his side. Sort of scary so I am glad we own and use a sleep positioner. Also, the sheets are extremely tight fitting and after accidentally putting them in the dryer, we had to then stretch them out manually because they no longer fit. Overall, better than a crib for those that want baby nearby and more spacious for those that are considering co-sleeping.",3
Arm's Reach Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet - Natural,"I use this as my baby's only bassinet, and move it from room to room (and around the living room) to keep the baby close to me.  Unlike the Graco Pack-n-Play, it's much smaller, lighter, and fits through narrow doorways.I originally imagined that I would use it as a co-sleeper.  However, after getting the baby home from the hospital I found him too noisy to have in the same room, so I detached this from the bed, set it up in free-standing mode, and moved it into the main living space (in a small apartment).The cloth sides make the bassinet fairly attractive.  The product is very sturdy and well-designed, and the extra pockets and bottom-storage space are quite useful.  The mesh on the sides makes it easy to see the baby from a chair.Note that most mobiles cannot attach (since there are no slats), so I recommend the ""JL Childress Crib Mobile Attachment Clamp, White"".Since this product will only be used for ~1 year, I recommend looking for a used one on craigslist (like I did)!Note: you don't need to buy the expensive matching sheets.  A large pillowcase will do the trick, or waterproof mats/sheets.",5
Arm's Reach Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet - Natural,"We don't have a large bedroom, so the Mini works great!  I love that our baby is right next to us, I'm right there if he needs me, and I feel quite secure using it.  It's also quite small which makes for easy travel when we go on an overnight trip somewhere.  It was definately worth it.",5
Arm's Reach Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet - Natural,"We all really like this mini co-sleeper.  We've been using it at night and for naps for 3 months now and have had no problems.  I had a C-section, but my hubby slept next to baby during those sore weeks and handed her to me for nursing.  Now I sleep next to her and it is such a handy arrangement.The co-sleeper attaches to the bed with straps that fit under the mattress.  We had to buy a set of bed height extenders at Bed,Bath,and Beyond for about $15 and they work great - very sturdy.  We decided on those versus the extenders that are made to go with the co-sleeper based on poor review of that product.The mattress is very firm and my baby seems to find it comfortable in all sleeping positions.  The sheet attaches very securely to the mattress with velcro.  I've read reviews of the sheet shrinking in the dryer, but I have not had that problem.  I did forgo purchasing a second matching sheet due to expense.  I found a NoJo bedside sleeper sheet at Babies R Us for $8.99.  It is 100% cotton and fits the mattress perfectly.This co-sleeper is a great product if you have limited space.  It has storage underneath which I use for extra bedding.  It also has pockets on both ends (4 in total) that would be a good place for burp rags, pacifiers, etc.",5
Arm's Reach Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet - Natural,"First of all, it is impossible to clean well because the fabric is not detachable.  Second of all, the screws in the metal rods wore down after only a few months and could not be re-tightened because they had bent from wheeling it around, rendering it a safety hazard.  I bought this with the hopes of using it for more than one child, but alas, it's useless now.  I will not buy another product from this company.  Want a good night's sleep with your tiny baby?  Get a noah basket and put your mattress on the floor. It sounds inconvenient but any experienced parent who believes in the virtues of cosleeping will swear by it.",1
Mini Electric Replacement Motor,"Ok, this is going to sound SO strange; yet, I swear this is a true story.  I'm 43 years old, and I learned last December that I was pregnant. When I had my first child, 14 years ago, I bought the Medela breast pump, which was wonderful. I loved this pump. After I was done with the breastfeeding thing, I just shelved it -- forgot all about it -- and then, when I had my second daughter, just this month, I became engorged, and I remembered my good ol' Medela breast pump that I had used so faithfully from years and years ago... Guess what?  I found it, cleaned it up, and that thing STILL WORKED FLAWLESSLY!!!  Un-freakin-believable... the only problem I had was, after an insane weekend, I fell off the breastfeeding schedule and became engorged (how painful!). I got out that old Medela, and I pumped away, and in the process (never thought about this) ended up pumping for close to an hour and a half... well, little did I know, that was too much for a one time pumping session, and I ended up blowing that motor (but come on, that thing worked fine until then -- and it WAS 14 years old). So, I came online to see if I could buy a replacement motor, and lo and behold, here it is. YEAH!!  For ANYONE who has any doubts, whatsoever, about ordering this product, you have my solemn vow that you CAN NOT GO WRONG WITH A MEDELA!  Now, I just may order the Medela SWING instead (since it is a heavier duty -- daily pumping ok model).  The Mini Electric is suitable for pumping only about four days a week, so I did ""overuse it"" quite badly... but it has held up very well.Medela is the Mercedes of breast pumps, if you ask me.",5

Medela Pump In Style 9 Volt Advanced Breastpump Battery Pack,"I purchased this to use while pumping and traveling. The adapter is quite expensive for what it is (essentially a plastic holder with an electric plug. The batteries aren't even included!

Medela Pump In Style 9 Volt Advanced Breastpump Battery Pack,"I have the insurance issued Medela pump (in the little tan 'bag'). I tried rechargeable batteries (charged for 24hrs) in it and it was pitiful. Put in brand new Energizer batteries...worked almost just as much power w/ the plug, but haven't seen how many pump sessions I get out a set of batteries. It's mostly for back up for when I don't have an outlet near by so it's worth it rather than shelling out the $350-400 for the Freestyle pump, at this point in time.",3
Medela Pump In Style 9 Volt Advanced Breastpump Battery Pack,I put brand new batteries in and putting my pump at the medium setting (using the battery pack) still only felt the same as the low setting (using the wall plug).I will only be using this item as an emergency back up.,3
Medela Pump In Style 9 Volt Advanced Breastpump Battery Pack,This battery pack was a lifesaver when I was breastfeeding/pumping.I was able to pump in my car or a bathroom that didn't have an outlet.So convenient.  Worked perfect with my Pump in Style.,5
Medela Pump In Style 9 Volt Advanced Breastpump Battery Pack,"I was pleased with the size and convenience of this product. Power was good not great, same as the car charger.",4
Medela Pump In Style 9 Volt Advanced Breastpump Battery Pack,"This was the smartest purchase I made for my breast-pumping routine. I realized that on a 12 hour international flight when found no socket in the plane restroom. So I had to use the battery pack to pump. Further on, I got to the hotel and found that the power adapter plug for this country and the power adapter of my medela breast pump simply would not work! So again, the battery pack saved me. One set of 8 batteries lasted me three days of round o'clock pumping and could probably last more, yet I decided to replace them for my flight back with new ones.",5
Medela Pump In Style 9 Volt Advanced Breastpump Battery Pack,"The product functions as advertised.  Stores easily in the pumps tote bag and makes traveling less stressful.  Good backup to the outlet included with the original pump, but battery life is short, less than 3 hours, so carry extra AA's.",5
Medela Pump In Style 9 Volt Advanced Breastpump Battery Pack,"I took this on a camping trip where I wouldn't have access to power, and it lasted through three 30-min pumping sessions with no sign of slowing. Giving 4 stars because it requires 8 AA batteries. I used rechargeable AA's and it still worked fine, but this can get expensive. I wish Medela would make a battery pack that was actually a chargeable power pack.",4
Medela Pump In Style 9 Volt Advanced Breastpump Battery Pack,"I bought this battery back as a back up when I need to pump and not near an outlet.  I have used it approximately 5 times, works well",5
Medela Pump In Style 9 Volt Advanced Breastpump Battery Pack,I have used 3-4 times so far and its worked well.  great for travel (in the car and at the airport).,5
Formula Dispenser,I love this dispenser! We live about an hour from both our families so when we visit we need to take plenty of formula. This allows us to take enough for the whole day. I always keep it full in the diaper bag casue you never know when you might need it! Very nice!,5
Shopping Cart Cover - Lil Dino Black,Love the pattern on it but had some difficulty placing this on the cart the first time and since it was too time consuming I just decided to not use it and just clean the cart instead.,3
Third Trimester Tea,Great product.  Very soothing and tasty.  The seller delivered in a timely fashion.,5
Baby Cie Succion Bowl - Les Animaux de la Ferme,"Functional and adorable as well--an excellent product!  Contrary to one of the reviews I saw, I had no trouble with the suction cup, it worked perfectly.  Customer service from Touch of Europe is excellent, too.  They are fast and courteous and we've been happy with every purchase.  Highly recommended!",5
Baby Cie Succion Bowl - Les Animaux de la Ferme,I love this bowl and my kids love it too! I have 2 and they've done the trick! Thanks again!,5
"Rain or Shine Kids Woobee Plush Blanket, Pink/Grey","I received this blanket and a matching bib when my daughter was born and have given them to all my friends for shower gifts.  It is my favorite blanket ever, I have three kids and wish I had it for my other two. I would recommend it to anyone!!",5
Evenflo Journey Stroller,I have just purchased this stroller today. I have about 6 strollers all together and this one seems to be the best thus far. I have a 4 year old who is Autistic and I like for her to have a place to rest when we are out shopping etc. She had outgrown her other strollers and this gives her plenty of room .She is very tall and has plenty of leg room and the seat is wide so she actually looks comfortable in it.  I like the steering and controlling ease this stroller provides. It has a nice size basket and two cup holders for the parent along with cushioned handles. I also  like the height of the stroller.The canopy is large and actually covers her.I also like the way it folds up and how the tray actually folds up with the stroller so I dont have a tray flopping around in the back of the van.  I did not give it four stars because I was disappointed that it does not have a cup holder for her on the tray.This is my only complaint.I would recommend this stroller for anyone who wants one for an older child and needs alot of room.,4
Fisher-Price Magic Rattle and Ride Pooh,This is cute but it is activated by shaking the rattle that comes with it. You have to shake it very hard to get it to move. Sometimes I could not even get it to move myself let alone a baby being able to do this. The concept is cute and the music is nice but I was disappointed by the effort required to get this to move. Its now in the toy box and has not been bothered with for quite sometime.,3
"Rain or Shine Kids Woobee Plush Blanket, Turquoise/Chocolate","This blanket is great. It is pretty much permanently tied to his car seat-- when he is dozing off, I flip it over.. when it is raining out I flip it over to keep him dry on way from car to house...you can also untie it and use it to sit on in the park. It's a great blanket.",5
Swaddlebees One-size Organic Velour Fitted (Peach),"This diaper is great.  I can't imagine a newborn wearing it, so the one-size isn't quite accurate until they start to get a good amount of weight on them, but it will certainly last a while hopefully through potty training.  I've only had it few about a week so I don't know how soft it'll stay after repeat washes, but it is very soft now!  And, I'm able to leave my baby without a diaper cover for a while without it getting wet on the outside.  Although, for extended/overnight wear or heavy wetters, a diaper cover is a must.  It's not waterproof by any means, but it is absorbent.  I'm going to buy one more.  :)",5
Washington Redskins NFL Football Newborn Baby Necessities Gift Set,"I love this gift I purchased for a coworker who now has a baby boy, and also a Redskin fan in the making!",5
Washington Redskins NFL Football Newborn Baby Necessities Gift Set,I purchased this for my daughter.  I can't wait to give it to her.  It is such a great set.,5
New York Jets NFL Football Newborn Baby Necessities Gift Set,"Even though I am a NY Giants fan, I did give this baby jets gift for a present (father and mother are Jets fans) and they loved it.  The used it right away when the baby came.",5
New York Jets NFL Football Newborn Baby Necessities Gift Set,"My daughter is a jet fan, she is having a baby so therefore i purchased everything with jets and she is very happy",5
Blue Zoo Burp Cloth Set,"Not only are these very pretty, the chenille side has become our baby's favorite texture.  She carries them around like they were a ""blankie"".  A little pricey but I'll buy more if they remain a comfort for the babe!",4
Evenflo Snugli Front and Back Carrier- Hunter Green,I did not like this carrier.  I wish I had kept the box so I could retrun it.  The straps dont stay put and to put your infant in the device takes an act of God.  Front carrier is ok but back carrier requires the child to be laying down and sitting still.  Two impossible request.,1
NoJo Jungle Babies 6 Piece Crib Bedding Set,This is an absolutely beautiful crib set. My son loves to look at all the animals on the bumper pads and he loves to feel the blanket. I recommend this set for anyone! It's awesome!,5
NoJo Jungle Babies 6 Piece Crib Bedding Set,"I bought this 2 years ago for our first son and it turned out better than I even expected. The colors and quality of this bedding are great. We are expecting boy # 2 in a few months and will be using this bedding set again. My son loved all the animals on it and still points them out when he sees it. I would recommend buying another sheet so you have at least 2 sets for all the wetting of the bed. Highly recommend, you will not be disappointed with it.",5
NoJo Jungle Babies 6 Piece Crib Bedding Set,"Nice colors, good quality, does not fade after washing, animals look great.  We converted the valance into a small pillow cover.The only problem for a 4 star review is that the comforter is stiff because of all the animals.... which means it is not soft for the baby to roll in it, or lie on it etc.. so not preferred by my daughter.  We are actually using a cheaper walmart set comforter which is much simpler printed and softer.  This is a standard nice looks vs. practicality issues we faced.",4
Bebesounds Digital Baby Scale,,4
Bebesounds Digital Baby Scale,"Just bought this. Every time you weigh the baby, you get different numbers. The variation is large enough that it makes it useless to track the weight of your baby. The baby was of course moving but no more than one would expect for a baby who is lying on a scale. My doctor's weighing scale is much better. This is a complete waste of money if your are using it for a baby. I also tried to weigh an object and found an 80 gram variation based on where I put the object on the scale. Unacceptable.Too bad because Graco generally makes good products.",1
Bebesounds Digital Baby Scale,My infant daughter was having trouble gaining weight for a few months. Thanks to this scale I was able to keep track of her weight gain and adjust her feedings as needed. It is a nice size that didn't take up to much space in our nrsery. I could slide it under the changing table and pull it out when I needed it.,5
Summer Infant Fingerbrush With Storage Case,This toothbrush and massager are great for all teething stages.  I use it every night with my 8 mo old to get him used to brushing his teeth.  My only complaint is the case is hard to open - but I guess that makes it a good thing to give him as I change his diaper...,4
Summer Infant Fingerbrush With Storage Case,But it works. I wouldn't use this if your baby has teeth or is a biter.,3
,"I needed to find a really cute gender neutral bedding set, and this one is perfect!  The colors are great, the animals are so cute, and there are so many different textures of material.  It is very high quality. I not only have the bedding set but also the laundry hamper, the lamp shade and the wall hangings.  My daughter loves staring at all the animals,especially the panda bear.  Great product.",5
Peg Perego Aria Light Weight One Hand Fold Stroller in Mint,"Did a lot of research with stroller weight being a key factor.  Chose the Aria OH as it was the most functional lightweight stroller.  What's great is that it is a full stroller - nothing like an umbrella stroller.Pros - Large seat area for child, easy reclining adjustment, large and adjustable canopy top, large storage basket, easily maneuverable with one hand, easily open and closed with one hand (once you get the hang of it).Cons - Cheap and easily broken cup holder, can't really see child when canopy is open.",4
Peg Perego Aria Light Weight One Hand Fold Stroller in Mint,"We have had this stroller for about 6 months now, and we absolutely love it!  I bought it primarily because it is so lightweight and easy to collapse/expand with one-hand.  If that's your biggest priority, this is THE stroller to get!  Some of people's complaints about it are true - i.e., the ""recline"" option is a bit clumsy to use, the harness is a little complicated, etc.  But it's all about what's most important to you.  The things I love about this stroller are:1.  Lightweight2.  Easy to fold/unfold with one hand3.  Easy to pick up and put in trunk with one hand4.  Big storage area underneath (not as big as some, bigger than others)5.  Coffee holder (not as useful as some, but at least there is one!)6.  Pretty to look at7.  Harness not attached to seat (at first I didn't like this, but as my daughter's gotten older, she's 13 mos. now, this has become more important because she likes to be able to sit all the way up to see things, etc.)8.  Sun shade that really works (though not as fully-functional on some other strollers)9.  Easy to maneuver with one hand (even through doorways, over thresholds and curbs, etc.)10.  Brake is easy to apply and release11.  Good fabricAll in all, this is a great combination of options and features for the money, and I wouldn't trade it for anything!",4
Peg Perego Aria Light Weight One Hand Fold Stroller in Mint,"Obviously some of these reviewers have just had bad luck with this stroller.  True, the snack/cup holder is a joke and kept popping out since day one and it's a little hard to clean if you have kids that make a real mess with stuff like ice cream and such, but I've got to tell you, this stroller has taken a beating and is still holding strong.  It's been to Australia and back 8 times, not to mention the amount of trips its travelled by air all over the USA.  Now you know how luggage gets thrown about and treated at the airport, right?  So, it's a fantastic stroller to travel with... light and super durable!",4
Peg Perego Aria Light Weight One Hand Fold Stroller in Mint,"Where do I start. For our third child, we decided to get Peg Perego. Stroller is light-weight, and can be pushed one handed,and is easy to handle.No other redeeming qualities. Cup-holder is a joke, and broke off the first day. Snack tray pops out repeatedly. Harness is ridiculous, very cumbersome to put on, requires about 10 steps to put on. High pinch factor. Harness requires the child be absolutely still, which is not possible. Back-rest requires three hands to operate. With the back-rest down and with the infant car seat,cannot access the storage basket.Got taken in by the Peg Perego name, never again.",2
Peg Perego Aria Light Weight One Hand Fold Stroller in Mint,"We almost didn't buy a Peg Perego because of all the negative reviews, but we bought the Aria anyway and we're glad we did.  As I assembled it, I noticed that you had to be very careful to assemble it correctly.  Otherwise, you could damage it permanently.  As I read some of the complaints, I guessed that they either didn't assemble it correctly or have an older model.  Ours is perfect -- we have had no problems with and use it all the time.  Our son loves it -- it's comfortable for him and gets excited when he sees us pulling it out.",5
Peg Perego Aria Light Weight One Hand Fold Stroller in Mint,This stroller rocks!  I love the easy to carry handle it comes with.  It really is lightweight and easy to manuever.  No annoying latch to mess with when folding and unfolding like other strollers from the past.  I have gotten alot of compliments on the style too!  Most important thing is it saves my back!,5
NoJo Jungle Babies Window Valance,"We really like these valances.  They have such cute characters on them.  We highly recommend them!  The only downfall is having to iron them after they come out of the dryer, but it's worth it!",4
NoJo Jungle Babies Window Valance,"It looks more than perfect in my son's nursery...... great quality, love the coloring, its just exactly was the seller described....",5
NoJo Jungle Babies Window Valance,"As other reviewers have pointed out, this valance is very inconsistent. We have the large bedding set that came with one but needed another. Even with the reviews, I thought I'd give it a try since we needed another. What else can you do? Unfortunately it is not the same color, materials, or length. What a disappointment to not be able to finish the nursery. This product is being returned.",2
5 Piece Set (includes: Diaper Stacker),"I really like this crib set, i bought it for my son who loves bright colors...when i put him in his crib he likes to ""talk"" to the cute velvety farm animals in his bumper...Overall, I think he likes the comforter because its very soft and colorful. I would definately recommend this to anyone....I just wish it was a little bit less expensive, especially if you want to decorate your entire baby s room with this theme!",5
NoJo Jungle Babies Coral Fleece Blanket,"My son &#34;discovered&#34; this blanket at about nine months although it was in his room from when he was born. He loves it -- it's the only thing he's become attached too, so much so that at 3 1/2 years old now, we are on our third version of it. It's soft and fluffy and perfect size for a toddler to cuddle with. I don't know what I am going to do the day I find he doesn't need this anymore :-)",5
NoJo Jungle Babies Coral Fleece Blanket,This blanket is so soft and well made.  It is a perfect addition to the set as the comforter is too bulky to use in the crib - this will certainly keep baby warm!,5
NoJo Jungle Babies Wallpaper Border,"Very nice quality. Easy to use, just dunk in water for a few sec and up it goes.  Easily cuts to fit any room. I needed two rolls to complete a room of normal size. Has not bubbled or pealed in two years.",5
NoJo Jungle Babies Wallpaper Border,Lovely border to compliment the nojo jungle baby range - really easy to apply but I would recommend not leaving it to soak before applying - we filled the bath up wet the backing and put it straight up and worked great :-)) -Does take two people as its a bit awkward to do on your own but goes on great - would definatley recommend and looks so cute :-)),5
NoJo Jungle Babies Wallpaper Border,"This border turned out great in my nursury. As far as I know my husband did not even have a hard time putting it up. However, the room is not very big and we ended up needing two rolls. I would say the room is about 10 ft by 10 ft, maybe a little more.",4
NoJo Jungle Babies Wallpaper Border,The wallpaper border was purchased for my new grandson's bedroom. Everything is coordinated and the wallpaper border real pulls the jungle look together.,5
NoJo Jungle Babies Wallpaper Border,This wallpaper border goes great with my son's nursery theme. It sticks very well and I'm very pleased with this product. I will be using this seller again in the near future.,5
NoJo Jungle Babies Wallpaper Border,"Love the product. So adorable and easy to put up. Install instructions on product Is good, however, if you have never hung a wall border before, Suggest going to YouTube for a demonstration.Looks great in baby nursery. Received quickly after ordering.",5
NoJo Jungle Babies Wallpaper Border,"I have been completely satisfied with this purchase. The border looked just like it did in the pictures, so there were no surprises there. We had the border completely hung in about 45 minutes (the room is 9'x9') and had no issues hanging it - it was forgiving enough that we were able to shift it a little and smooth out bubbles after initially placing it, but then once we had it smooth and in the right place, it stayed put. We've had it up for maybe six months now and there are no signs of peeling. And it really did perk up the room!",5
NoJo Jungle Babies Wallpaper Border,"I love this border...it added the final necessary touch to make our son's room complete!I was tempted to try and hang it myself when it arrived cause I was so anxious to see it up but I'm glad I didn't try - you definitely need 2 people to hang it. My husband and I filled the bathtub up with a few inches of water to soak the border and it worked out great! One bit of advice - the instructions say to wait a few minutes after soaking to put the border up. DON'T WAIT! On the 2nd wall we waited a couple minutes after taking it out of the water cause we thought it would make the paste ""pastier"" but no - it just dried the paste up and we had to use glue to get a lot of the border to stick. On the 3rd wall we went directly from the water to the wall - didn't wait one bit, and that wall turned out the best! And pre-measure your room too...I only got 1 border and needed 2 so I had to wait for the 2nd one to arrive before I could finish the room.Overall I would definitely recommend this border!",5
NoJo Jungle Babies Wallpaper Border,"i thougth this can stick easy, but it do not bring any gum and was very hard to do it...",3
NoJo Jungle Babies Hamper,"I ordered this hamper because it matches my daughter's room decor, but I was very dissapointed by the quality of the wood. It is not very sturdy. I looks cheap. I wouldn't recommend this to a friend.",2
NoJo Jungle Babies Hamper,"I love this hamper. Its not only cute and matches my baby's bedding, but its functional. It has a mesh liner inside that is easily removable which allows me to tote the laundry downstairs to the washer. I actually appreciate the comments from the other posting, and I avoided placing the the items in the dryer. I washed everything and allowed it to air dry and it fit nicely back onto the wooden hamper stand. Excellent Product!",5
NoJo Jungle Babies Hamper,It's absolutely adorable but the material isn't the greatest. I repaired one of the seems that split but both the inner and outer material continued to rip under normal usage. I still recommend it.,4
NoJo Jungle Babies Musical Mobile,"The animals are cute. Assembly is (for the most part, see below) easy, and it attaches well to our crib.The music is loud and the quality is AWFUL. I suspect it might induce nightmares rather than an actual desire to sleep. I don't expect that we'll use it. Ever. Which is too bad, because it means that we'll have to turn the mobile by hand since the two features do not operate independently. However, as another reviewer noted, one of the animals/palm tree arms is too big to fit past the arm assembly as it turns in any case.The pieces all clipped together easily except for the music box; the hook on the arm attachment has insufficient space to allow the music box portion to slide on. We'll need a zip tie or an s-hook to complete assembly.I feel as though this product did not actually go through a thorough QA process - they missed the part where they tried all of the pieces together.",2
NoJo Day at the Zoo Hamper,"I am very pleased with this purchase.  The monkey applique and green gingham trim are cute and made from quality fabric.  The wood frame and canvas fabric are somewhat cheap, but they seem to be comparable to the other baby hampers on the market.  The hamper would probably be too small for a larger child's clothing, but baby clothing fits fine.  I have even tossed in heavier items (blankets, towels, etc.) and the hamper is sturdy enough to handle them. The removable mesh liner is convenient for toting laundry to the washing machine.",4
6 Piece Set,"I was unsure how the colors would work in our baby boy's room, but it looks great and is so cute!  This is a great bedding set!  I even bought the lampshade and mobile to go with it, as well as an extra sheet.  Very cute for boy, girl, or unknown!",5
NoJo Jungle Babies Crib Sheet,"I love this sheet!  It is adorable, comfortable, reasonably priced and well made.  I think this product is worth the money.",5
NameTrain Engine,This is used as a decoration right now but my son loves to look at it and play with it supervised. Cute!,4
NameTrain Engine,"This is a beautiful engine-shaped Name Train vehicle that can be added on to your other letter-shaped Name Train vehicles as the lead locomotive. It looks great, it feels great, and it rolls great. 5 Stars",5
Luvable Friends 9 oz. Halloween Baby Bottle - Printed with Latex Nipple,Very cute product. Just loved it. Bought  it for my new grandson first Halloween. It is adorable. Wish I could find one for thanksgiving.,5
Haba Bear's Cave Toy,"If you're looking for a great shower gift or a holiday gift for an infant, consider this toy. Our 4-month-old enjoys grabbing the bear and crinkling her cave - it's actually the first toy she ever reached for while playing on the floor. Her 9-month-old cousin loves it, too. The colors and textures are wonderful, and it's just so darn cute and different. HABA makes beautiful, durable toys, not just your run-of-the-mill chunks of plastic. Highly recommended.",5
"LA Baby Stop And Go Self Closing Safety Gate, White","We actually had to order another gate because we were very happy with the first one. They are ALL plastic with the exception of the adjusters for the doorway. But no metal to get hurt on, and they close themselves simply by tilting the top of the gate slightly and lock when they close. We will defenitley keep these forever, and Im sure they will last forever. Very well constucted, and they look great too. Thanks Again for a great product !!",5
"LA Baby Commercial/Restaurant Wooden High Chair, Cherry","If you want something smaller and easier to clean up, this is it.  If you have been to a restaurant and want one like they have, here it is.My only complaint is that I was missing two screws and had to go purchase from a local store - could not find the exact screw.",5
"LA Baby Commercial/Restaurant Wooden High Chair, Cherry","Purchased this for a 2 year old, and it was easy to assemble, safe, and he loved it.  The only thing is that it didn't quite fit underneath our kitchen table, but it still was close enough.",4
"LA Baby Commercial/Restaurant Wooden High Chair, Cherry","We have a very active 2year old grandson and this chair is wonderful for him. It's so great, we bought another one for his parents to use at their house. It's very simple to put together, sturdy, and easy to keep clean. And, it's a nice looking piece of furniture. You won't mind having this high chair sitting out.",5
"LA Baby Commercial/Restaurant Wooden High Chair, Cherry","The package arrived when it was supposed to, but after putting together two, (for twins) we discovered that a buckle on one was broken. Although this product is advertised as having several coats of lacquer, ours have rough spots throughout.This is clearly a very, very cheap product and not one that I am proud to own.Trust me, no restaurant would want to have any little patrons served in these!!",2
"LA Baby Commercial/Restaurant Wooden High Chair, Cherry","I bought the highchair for my Yorkie.  She always gets treats at the dinner table; I was tired of bending over.  Surprisingly she loves it.  It is a very durable built, perfect to sit at the table chair.  My great grandson will be enjoying it soon I Niki will agree to share.  The price was great.",5
"LA Baby Commercial/Restaurant Wooden High Chair, Cherry",I have theses chairs for a while and they work out prefect. I wish they had shorter chairs to hide under the table. Other than that point I love these chairs and would recommend these to any one with children over the age of 1.,5
"LA Baby Commercial/Restaurant Wooden High Chair, Cherry",I checked on many web sites and found this to be the best for your money.  This chair is very study and the wood is very good.  Enjoy using every day.  My Grandson lives with me and he enjoys sitting at the table with the rest of the family.  I strongly would suggest this item to anyone.And at 62 it wasn't to bad to put together................ My Grandson will be 2 this coming Jan.,5
"LA Baby Commercial/Restaurant Wooden High Chair, Cherry","Bought this baby chair so our first grandchild can sit at the table with us. It works very well and the chair is well made. I bought a second for him to have at home. The down side: the chair was tricky to put together; needed two of us to hold pieces while parts were screwed together. Also, the strap placement allowed my grandson too much wiggle room, but that is minor. I wanted this type of restaurant chair because it is easier to clean and store. I would buy this one again as I've see some really flimsy versions.",4
"LA Baby Commercial/Restaurant Wooden High Chair, Cherry","This wooden high chair is sturdy, well made, and easy to put together.  I did find that it is too high to be used at a game table but works very well with the standard height dining table.  It is just what I needed and small enough that I can put it in the trunk of my car if I need to take it to a friend's.  The only drawback I can see is that you have to use it at a table which limits its use. If you go on outings where tables are not available, you would do better getting one with a tray.",5
"LA Baby Commercial/Restaurant Wooden High Chair, Cherry","I bought two of these, one for my grandson at home and one for our house for when he visits. The chair is sturdy, decent quality, and simple to clean. It allows baby to be up at the table with the adults and there's no tray to mess with. Definitely recommend it as it will last through toddler years. One issue, it is a bit fussy to put together so be sure to have the right tools.",5
Baby Einstein Lights &amp; Melodies Discovery Center,"Bought this for my son when he was 2month old.  He didn't care much for it.  Light flashed no reaction.  Didn't really play with it for a while then when he reached 5-6 months he started to play with it.  He can't put the basketball in the hoop to make the song play but I stick plush football, baseball, stuff animals (purchased separately) and he would pull it out and loves it.  He slowly began to notice the other features and not his favorite toy but he seems to like it.",4
Baby Einstein Lights &amp; Melodies Discovery Center,My 3month loves it!! we introduced it to him at 8 weeks old and it still keeps him entertained; i don't think the music is annoying; volume is adjustable so it's not loud.  At first i didn't think much of it; but my son just loves it!!,5
Baby Einstein Lights &amp; Melodies Discovery Center,"My baby doesnt seem to be interested in this toy. She looks at it but then quickly loses interest (she's only 6 months). If I put her in a ""Bumbo"" Chair in front of it, she will entertain herself by playing with the ""animal sounds"" wheel, but nothing else. The volume is very loud and not adjustable. The music is also annoying. I hope when she gets to be at least 1, she'll appreciate it more.",2
Baby Einstein Lights &amp; Melodies Discovery Center,"This toy is well made.  It's adjustable for different ages - you can make it so the caterpillar will face down so infants laying beneath it can see everything.  It's durable, and great for the price!  Love it!",5
Baby Einstein Lights &amp; Melodies Discovery Center,my 4-month old son showed absolutely no interest in this product. don't recommend it at all.,2
Boppy Cradle In Comfort Bouncer - Blue,"So far, all I have is assembly experience with this seat, I'm not due for three weeks.  I got it, was really excited, took it out of the box, and started putting pieces together.  After 10 minutes I was done, with minimal help from the instructions.  We are in the process of moving, however, and I didn't realize that once you put it together you can't take it apart without unscrewing pieces that aren't meant to come apart.  I wish they made it collapsible or something, like the boppy travel swing.  Another thing I noticed is that the toy bar is really right there in the baby's face.  Again, the travel swing has much better design in this area too.",3
Boppy Cradle In Comfort Bouncer - Blue,"This was a gift for my sister's new baby.  He loves it!  She loves it!  It's a little more expensive than similar models, but the gentle vibration and music are wonderful.  Worth the extra $$.",5
Boppy Cradle In Comfort Bouncer - Blue,"I borrowed this from a friend for several months. My baby was always happy to hang out in it. I didn't have the hanging toy bar (didn't know there was one), but it still was a great place to set her down safely. All the fabric was removable and washable and cleaned up nicely. I used this when I started feeding her solids since I didn't have a high chair, and she seemed able to swallow easily and her head was supported so it was easy for me to feed her without her bobbing around. I loved it. She seemed too heavy for it by 19 pounds. I had a regular (boring) bouncer of my own, but for the next baby I'll buy one of these for myself. Great bouncer.",5
Boppy Cradle In Comfort Bouncer - Blue,"This seat is entertaining and yet not too stimulating so that the baby could relax and maybe take a nap in it, and that is exactly why I bought it. But if you are looking for something more fun and exciting for your baby to play in then I would suggest something like the fisher price rainforest bouncer.This seat looks very cozy, but I'm not sure that it really is. It seems to me that my son's back is always arched when he's sitting in it. I don't think that the curvature of the back of the seat is right for the baby's back, and that applies for both the reclined and inclined positions. On the other hand, the fact that it has 2 positions is very useful. I mostly keep it in the reclined position but I use the other position when the baby had just finished eating to keep him slightly upright to stop him from spitting up.The pad that lies under the baby is not fixed to the lining of the seat and keeps slipping down and folding under the baby making him uncomfortable. The cushions on the sides of the pad are cozy for a newborn baby but once the baby becomes more active, they seem to hinder his arm movement. I would suggest that you remove the pad and the little pillow once your baby is able to support his own head, although it is easier to wash the pad rather than remove the whole seat lining to wash it.The vibration and the music seem to have a soothing effect on my son although it took him a while to get used to the vibration, it made him cry the first few times we turned it on.The curved bar that holds the toys above the baby could simply be pushed back making it easy to put the baby in and take him out of the seat. I think it is more user friendly than most other seats.I would give this 3 and half stars if I could. Good luck making the right choice and I hope my review is helpful.",3
Boppy Cradle In Comfort Bouncer - Blue,"I love Boppy and I love this product.  I swear it came from my own head....I bought this for my third baby, born only a few weeks ago.  For the past two kids I have put them in the Boppy on the floor or on the couch when I was there.  But with two kids around it made it harder for me to put the newborn down without fear of the kids accidently hurting her.  I kept thinking, ""if only they combined the Boppy pillow with the safety of a bassinet.""  THIS IS IT!!  My baby loves it - she is snug as a bug in it and it's off the ground which keeps her out of harms way.  I highly reccomend this product.",5
Boppy Cradle In Comfort Bouncer - Blue,"We used this bouncer from day one for my daughter.  She was very comfortable in it and we often used it for her to nap in.  The only issue we had was that the vibrating motor got very loud after several weeks.  We contacted the company and they sent us a new one, no questions asked.  This actually happened twice, and the second time they sent us a whole new chair for free.  In the end, it remained a little on the noisy side, but not too bad and overall, the chair has been great.  Only lasts until about 4 months when they really get too big, but a big help for those 4 months.",4
Boppy Cradle In Comfort Bouncer - Blue,Very beautiful and comfortable looking. Does not bounce unless you do it manually (it vibrates).  Not easy to move around.  You naturally reach for the top and the awning falls right off. I got it as a gift but would not purchase it myself.,3
Boppy Cradle In Comfort Bouncer - Blue,"We checked out all the bouncers we could in several stores, and this was our favorite by far. It's so soft, the toys are especially cute and well made, and it's very springy.Someone posted an adorable customer photo that shows the boppy insert as green, I just wanted to note that it wasn't, or at least, ours wasn't, so I'm not sure if that's just from the initial model or if they changed their's out?The cloth is exceedingly cuddly. My husband noted that it's definitely not very portable, which is true. It's more of a stationary piece of furniture.",5
Boppy Cradle In Comfort Bouncer - Blue,"We had a Fisher Price Kick n Play bouncer for my son when he was a baby.  There are many parents out there who can claim ""The bouncer was our lifesaver!"" or ""The bouncer was the only place he'd sleep!"" and so on.I was not one of those parents.He didn't like the seat, he didn't like the toys, he didn't like the vibration.  The bouncer was of *very* limited use for us and we got rid of it.  We wanted another child but didn't think we'd want a bouncer.  Then I got pregnant with twins and it occurred to me that I was going to want/need as many ways to sit one down as possible.And ah...  what's nice about parenthood the second time around?  You know enough to buy everything you can used, used, used.  I had never seen this bouncer before but came across one on craigslist.  It looked so much more comfy than the FP ones.  The baby could actually sink into it and relax, like those big papasan chairs for adults.  I managed to snag 2 of them, used, for about half the price of one new.  Which means I learned right off the bat that the covers for these things wash up very well - good to know!This was an awesome seat for my babies for the first 2 months or so.  They would sleep here most of the day.  It held them all snuggled and happy...  until they got to the rolling over or arching stages where they'd weasle their way out.  (I am not a fan of the restraint on these because it seems like by the time you go through all the fuss to restrain the kid, they are angry and yelling their head off, so you have a screaming baby in a bouncer - not fun!)  So we set the bouncers aside for a while...  and then got them back out a couple months once they were a little more into sitting and looking...  They're also great when I need to give both babies a bottle at once.  (No [.......] is best remarks here - they get that, too.  But I don't make enough for two!  :-)  )The good - they're comfy!  They're cute!  They wash well and stay looking new.  And they bounce - the FP papasan doesn't bounce, seems silly to me.  And they are sturdy, which I know because my 4yo son keeps sitting in them.  They take a beating and pop right back up.The bad - the music and vibration is wasted on my kids.  With all 3 of my kids, when I have put vibration on the bouncer I have gotten reactions ranging from concern to indifference - but it never soothed them.  My son's bouncer didn't have music, but these do, and it does nothing for my girls.  So you pay extra money for this C-battery-taking box you have to pop on and off to wash this thing...  pointless.  The toy bar is also pointless - it came off way too easily to begin with and then my son took one of them and started walking around the house whacking things with it so now it's bent out of shape and come off it you just look at it wrong.  You pay extra for these two things and you don't need them.As a cozy, soft seat for baby, this is awesome.  But the full price of new is absurd.  Look for one used and you won't be sorry!  4 stars instead of 5 is because of the price.",4
Boppy Cradle In Comfort Bouncer - Blue,"Our son loves these!!  We have 2, one for downstairs (the blue model sold at BRU) and one for use in the bathroom (this one) while we are getting ready in AM.  This one seems larger and more round than the Boppy blue one but both are great.  This one is more papasan like. He has loved it since birth and is now almost 19# and 8.5 months old.  He loves to nap in it now.  We did have to remove the toy bar now as he likes to do pull-ups on it so not so safe now.  He loved playing with the toys when he was younger though.  The music and sounds are nice as is the vibration mode.  This has made shower time and nap time so much easier in our household!  Now if someone would only come up with one for older, heavier infants that would be great since weight limit is 25#.  Great Item.  I highly recommend the Boppy brand bouncers over other brands I have seen in use at friends houses.",5
My Brest Friend Navy Spiral Cover,,5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Slipcover, Blue","Like the deluxe slipcovers a lot better than the regular.  The quiet release clip helps a lot.  I was disappointed when ordering the Blue.  It is not the color shown, it is more or a baby blue (light pastel color).  The sunburst print on this page is also not DELUXE even thought it shows as an option under that title.",4
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Slipcover, Blue",We found My Brest Friend 3 years ago for our first child and was happy to find this affordable cover. This makes it convenient to wash one while using the other.,5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Slipcover, Blue","I prefer the original Brest Friend covers, but I'm not crazy about the velcro strap.  I love this nursing pillow overall, and it helps with positioning.  I'm nursing a 3 month old and still use this pillow at home every day.  I was ready to quit nursing because positioning my preemie was so difficult, but I saw this in the hospital ""nursing shop"" and made my husband buy it for me.  WHAT A DIFFERENCE!! It's far better than the Boppy pillow and doesn't roll the baby or move from my waist.  There is nothing bad I have to say about the Brest Friend... skip the popular Boppy and get this!  It rescued my nursing experience.",4
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Slipcover, Blue","I wish the cover is waterproof. Since my breast milk drip/overflow and when it falls on this, it seeps through into the sponge below.",3
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Slipcover, Blue",Soft like the original green cover that it came with...lifesaver when my baby's diaper overflowed during a feeding!  The pink is a sweet pastel color.,5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Slipcover, Blue","Because you have to air dry this cover, I own two. The my Brest Friend pillow is awesome. Perfect for breastfeeding mothers. It makes long feedings comfortable and  easy! This cover washes well and doesn't pill.",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Slipcover, Blue","I love MBF pillow!  I highly recommend these things!  I'm no longer using it since my little man is bigger, but I am certainly looking forward to using it again with future little ones.  The covers are line dry only, and with a sloppy nurser, it was great to have a spare cover.  The deluxe covers are great.  I never really used the velcro feature, but these covers are much much softer than the original ones.",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Slipcover, Blue","This cover is just OK.  I'm surprised at some of the reviews praising the softness; it just is not as soft as the cover that came with my Deluxe (which was the Periwinkle one).  It's also slightly smaller and the closing mechanism and velcro is not to the standard of the Periwinkle one.  I use theMy Brest Friend Professional Slipcoverover the pillow itself for waterproofing, and the inferior softness (and thinness of the fabric) is much more obvious then (though not with the original cover).  It's OK in a pinch (if the original one is in the wash), but look for one of the others instead (like the Periwinkle, which apparently isn't on Amazon, orMy Brest Friend Deluxe Nursing Pillow - Sweet Blossom).",3
Baby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper,"We have a 2 year-old and quadruplet 1 year-olds in our home.  We already owned an Evenflo exersaucer that my 2 year-old used as a baby.  We were very happy with that exersaucer, but needed to add another one with the addition of four babies.  We chose this Baby Einstein jumper and have been very happy with it.  The Baby Einstein jumper jumps a little easier as it is a spring jumper whereas the Evenflo has springs as well, but it is plastic on plastic when the baby jumps.  The Baby Einstein jumper has 6 height levels which has been VERY nice as most jumpers only have 3 height levels.  The cloth seat is easily removable for cleaning, the colors are bright and engaging and the toys are fun.  It has been a big hit in our house and was VERY easy to put together.  I wish that there would have been more hanging toys included for the price.  In my opinion, it is nice to have hanging toys to swap out...some of your own and some that come with the jumper.  This is a very good jumper and was put to the test with four babies all at once and it survived!  I would highly recommend this jumper.",5
Baby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper,"There isn't anything I dislike about this thing. We looked at exersaucers and doorway jumpers, and this gives you the best of both worlds. It was quick to set up and it's a cinch to adjust the seat height. It's easy to clean; the toys and seat cover go on and off with no trouble. The piano was my baby's favorite toy. It has a volume switch, but even on it's loud setting it isn't annoying. You can also change it from piano setting to a setting that plays upbeat classical songs when you hit a key, which my baby loved. It's nice to be able to change out the hanging toys for variety. Even though he outgrew the seat around 9 mos, we left it out because he still enjoys hanging on to the outside and playing with the toys. I like that it folds for storage, too (though I haven't tried that yet).",5
Baby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper,"My 6 month old loves his activity center; hint if you play the Baby Einstein videos while your child is in this center you will have a very content baby (for those times you need a shower or 10 minutes alone).  My boy loved those door jam jumpers but we did not like the damage it made on our door jams so this activity center was the most logical purchase.  It is one short of 5 stars because he does not love it as much as the doorjam jumper (don't know why, it must not spring up as high).",4
MOBI Digital Ultra Thermometer,it took me a while to choose a thermometer and I basically went off of reviews. We love this thermometer. My four year old wants to play with it and its so easy to use that he can actually take my temp! Its readings are consistent and i do recommend this product.,4
MOBI Digital Ultra Thermometer,"Basically the worst thermometer I ever bought!  Very unreliable reading, and it is dangerous because you can miss a serious illness.",1
MOBI Digital Ultra Thermometer,This has not been accurate since I opened it.  I received it as a baby shower gift and was really exited because I could use it on my son's forehead instead of using the ear or rectal thermometer.  Half the time it reads less than 95 degrees with the forehead attachment and I'm not getting much better of a reading with the ear thermometer either.  I thought maybe that my son was too little or I was doing it wrong but I tried it on myself and my husband and got the same results.  I'm going to go with the Vicks  to see if it works any better.,1
MOBI Digital Ultra Thermometer,"This thermometer will give a reading that varies by 3 degrees when you measure the child 3 times in a row in the same spot on the forehead. Same with ear readings. Not only that, the reading is usually around the mid 90s. I used another more reliable digital thermometer after being exasperated with this one and got readings within a tenth of a degree near 101F. This Mobi thermometer is junk.",1
MOBI Digital Ultra Thermometer,"It seemed to work well at first, but then I began noticing discrepancies when i'd try to take temp a couple times in a row. This was within the first couple days of purchase. Needed a thermometer again, so pulled it out just to see if it would work, and i don't think i've once gotten an accurate temperature with it. maybe just a bad unit, but i can't even get a correct temperature from my own head/ear.",1
MOBI Digital Ultra Thermometer,"I was very excited to receive this thermometer, being a new mom I wanted to be prepared... But I tried the thermometer on my husband and I multiple times and every reading was different! Had to return the item simply because it did not work correctly, going to stick with the old fashion thermometer.",1
MOBI Digital Ultra Thermometer,"I had a tough time finding a thermometer that didnt have terrible reviews about inaccuracy. So I bought this one and love it!! It's so quick and always reads within a few decimal points when I take my newborns temp multiple times in a row! I've been using the forehead attachment, so convenient!",4
MOBI Digital Ultra Thermometer,My 2 year lod hates having her temp. taken. With this one she doesn't even know your taking it..,5
MOBI Digital Ultra Thermometer,Never felt like this product worked right.  Taking multiple readings in the same place would have result in a 4 degree range.  Had it for a year and a half....gonna throw it out...worthless.,1
MOBI Digital Ultra Thermometer,We were very happy with this thermometer for the first year we owned it.  We started to notice recently it was giving inaccurate temps (always showed lower than 95 degrees F)... We called the company and all they would say is that their warranty is for 3 months and that we need to purchase a new one.  This is just not acceptable.. If there is an expected lifetime for accuracy then they should indicate that on the package/docs.,2
MOBI Digital Ultra Thermometer,"I got this thermometer as a gift with my second baby.  We use the forehead attachment and nothing else really.  After spending 2 years with my first baby trying to use a ""regular"" thermometer or even other digital ones I found that this one is a thousand times easier.  There is a lot of talk about innaccurate readings but I think that mine varies very little actually.  PLUS, with the other type of thermometer my child was squirming and fussing so much that I often gave up on getting a reading at all because it was simply impossible.  So long as your child remains fairly still for the few seconds it takes to get a reading with the MOBI it will tell you what you need to know.  That is, does my child have a fever or not and is it abnormally high.  A few decimal points difference really doesn't matter that much.  If you need something super accurate you'll have to spend a lot more money.  I can attest to the fact that even doctor's offices thermometer's get ""inaccurate"" reads sometimes.  So, just relax and get this one. It should do the trick.  This is much, much, much better than anything else I have used.  Buy it, you'll like it (of course don't be mad at me if you don't like it...I do though)!",5
MOBI Digital Ultra Thermometer,"I've used this thermometer for the past 15 months for my daughter and it's been remarkably consistent.  I would recommend using tympanic membrane readings (ear) as this is a much more reliable way to measure temperature if done correctly.  To measure: Pull external ear up and back slightly, and aim thermometer level (not up or down) but slightly toward front of head - this positioning ensures you are measuring temperature at the membrane, not the ear canal.  The memory feature is very handy.  The back light is unobtrusive.  My daughter dislikes the electronic voice that gives you a verbal on the reading, but otherwise, this medical doctor finds this thermometer to be great!",5
MOBI Digital Ultra Thermometer,Inaccurate readings!  A big waste of money!  Every reading is different.  From 95.7 to 103.0  A quality thermometer is important and this is NOT it!,1
MOBI Digital Ultra Thermometer,"I like it because sometimes is hard to keep our newborn calm to take his temperature. Using the Mobi dual scan in the ear is very fast and easy to monitor his temperature.I don't use the talking mode, the screen is very clear and easy to read.Really liked it.",5
MOBI Digital Ultra Thermometer,"Temp readings are all over the place which make this completely worthless.  The  talking voice is annoying...I can read the temp on my own, thank you.",1
MOBI Digital Ultra Thermometer,"I recently bought this product for my baby. This thermometer even reads out the temperature for you, but if you find it annoying you can turn it off. You can set the date and year on there. It stores temperature readings for you. It is versatile- meaning it takes both the temple temp AND an ear temp. It's also takes fast reading so you don't have to struggle with a squirming child. The numbers are easy to read and it gives an accurate reading. I really love this product.",5
MOBI Digital Ultra Thermometer,"I bought this thermometer because I needed something reliable and quick.  So far, this has been both.  This reads ear and forehead temps.  I have tested this on myself and my son.  Over multiple readings, I have seen little variability in temps.  It has been consistent for both forehead and ear readings.  This was pretty simple to figure out and instructions were reasonably clear. So far, I am happy with this purchase.",4
MOBI Digital Ultra Thermometer,I recently ordered this product and received it the very next day . The product was in brand new condition in its original package.I really love it .. :),5
MOBI Digital Ultra Thermometer,I bought this as an add on gift so my daughter has in case my new grandson or anyone gets sick,5
MOBI Digital Ultra Thermometer,"Gives quick and reliable readings. May read a little in the high side, but it is consistent. I like the option to read the ear or the forehead.",5
MOBI Digital Ultra Thermometer,"I hate this one, it will give never give same reading again. Readings fluctuate by 2-3 degrees. I took readings one minute apart and got 99.0 100.5 and 101.4, when I was not feeling any temperature at all. My son was under some fever and it showed 107 degrees.Total waste of money and time.",1
MOBI Digital Ultra Thermometer,i just love this gadget. my patients are amazed at how they can hear what their temperature is. one patient ask me to make it talk for him. this is an excellent instrument and it comes in handy for a days work.,5
MOBI Digital Ultra Thermometer,"I bought this one since my regular thermonetor died on me.  This thing is worthless.  Everyone in my house got sick witht he ctomach flu and I needed to take temps.  i pull my cool looking new thermonetor out and got some funky temps.  I almost freaked out when I got a temp of 104 (by ear) for my four year old.  Then I took it again and it said 97, the third time it said 101.  i was so confused!  Then i did it with her forehead and got 97 all three times!  So I gave her some motrin and tried my 16 month old.  She hated it!  I had to pin her down just to get a reading and it said 95 all three times.  Later that evening it said 100.  Just now I tried reading my husband's temp and got 95 all three time by ear and forehead!  WOW!  I wish I kept the reciept!",2
My Brest Friend Pink Stripe Pillow,"I made my husband hunt all over town for one of these after my baby slipped between me and the Boppy pillow for the 100th time. Because you can attach MBF pillow to you, the baby stays securely on top of the pillow, allowing you and the baby to sit comfortably while you breastfeed. It has a lame name and an uninspiring design, but it is one of the most practical things you'll own if you're breastfeeding.",5
My Brest Friend Pink Stripe Pillow,"It's comfortable and helps a lot with your back. Unlike other nursing pillows, it stays in place and is made out of firm foam, so you avoid all the pushing and pulling a formless pillow. The pillow case can be washed in the washing machine, but can't be machine dried. It dries quickly though, because it's thin cotton.",5
My Brest Friend Pink Stripe Pillow,i bought this after i had a c section and i was so happy with it i gave my best friend the boppy i had.  the brest friend takes the pressure off the back and allows you to actually be comfy while feeding the baby.  i took it everywhere while my son was young enough.  i love this thing and i will be using it again for my second and my 3rd,5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","My wife really loves this, and chose it over the Boppy.  She liked it because it has the added back support and likes it a lot.  The one problem I had with it is the construction of the padding under the cover.  When we took it out of the bag it came in, it smelled like straight gasoline!  We decided to give it a try, and removed the cover and aired it out a little for a few days.  It subsided and was MUCH better.I think it has to do with the glue they use to put together the padding under the colorful cover, and the put it in the plastic display packaging before it has the chance to air out properly.  Either way, it works great after we got the smell off of it.  We are very particular about using clean and hypoallergenic items for the baby, so we would not have kept it unless we felt it was safe.I would recommend this to a friend, but I would also recommend they air it out before having it around kids.",4
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst",Unfortunately I fell victim to the strange smell coming from this as well.I thought it would go away after two days but it didn't. What's ironic is that the one we saw/smelled at a Baby's R Us store didn't have this strange smell. Perhaps since it was sitting longer? I'm not sure.Good luck finding one that does not have a strange smell.,1
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","I purchased my brestfriend after finding it challenging to get good positioning during nursing. This product made a huge difference to my ability to nurse comfortably and effectively. The firmness of the pillow is excellent and back support really helps to relieve back pain during breast-feeding. My initial complaint about the product was that the foam had a particularly noxious odor coming out of the packaging. I tried to let it air out for a few days with no real change. I called my brestfriend directly and couldn't have been more impressed with their customer service. Not only was I able to speak to a real person  immediately, but she was extremely apologetic and often to send a replacement pillow ASAP. She even upgraded me from the original pillow to the deluxe model. Apparently a batch of the pillows received too much glue and it was not given adequate time to dry before being put into the packaging, therefore accounting for the smell. She assured me that the smell was not toxic but agreed that it was extremely unpleasant. I would recommend this product to anyone and if you have the same experience that I did, I would simply call my brestfriend directly. They were great!",4
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","I had the boppy with the first baby, and got the Brest Friend with the 2nd baby.  I find that the Brest Friend gives a tighter fit.  The boppy keeps slipping.  The Brest Friend is nice because it locks around you, and if you have more than one kid, it helps support  your baby while you are breastfeeding and trying to deal with your older toddler.  I recommend this to all new mommies over the boppy!  The hospitals also recommend it, and I see why!  It does give you a more secure fit!",5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst",This is basically a review based on what she told me . She says that while its really great its not something that you want to pull out in the middle of night trying to feed the baby . This works better on a couch or something rather than in bed . Overall a great product she just says its too much of a hassle at night.,4
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","This was like an extension of my body for over seven months. I stopped using it only when my son outgrew it. Supports your back nicely and positions the baby in such a way to free up your hands. I would highly recommend it to new moms, especially those who had c-sections.",5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","Pros: stays on when moving around, nice positioning for baby, adjustable strapCons: the back rest hurt my back a little bit, takes a little longer to get on than a simple Boppy",4
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst",It's kinda pricey. I ended up only using it one time because my little one did better feeding on a slight angle to avoid spitting up.,3
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","I've been using this since my daughter was born.  It functions really well.  Good support and easy to use.  Although, I don't care for the round, elevated pillows.  Also, it's tough to quietly unlock this belt. I know this is foam, which usually has fire retardants, and I prefer not to expose my daughter to toxic chemicals.  So, before using this pillow I went on their website, which states the following:""We stopped using fire retardants with our foam some years ago.  We test all of our foam and products using Intertek laboratories, considered to be one of the leading independent testing laboratories in the world. All of our tests have passed the legal and strictest safety regulations. We continue to test all residuals for safety, and the results show that they are either nonexistent or at a level that is considered to be ""non-detectable"" by the laboratory, and therefore considered safest.""But, a recent report by Washington Toxics Coalition (WTC) tested the foam in a laboratory and found existing TDCPP (chlorinated Tris).  So, flame retardants are detectable and exist in this pillow unlike their promise.Here's what the WTC report says about TDCPP in case you think it's safe ([...]):""TDCPP was designated as a carcinogen by the State of California under Proposition 65 in October 2011 based on laboratory studies finding increases in kidney, liver, and testicular tumors as well as evidence of mutagenicity[9, 10]. Previously, a Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) assessment designated the chemical as a probable carcinogen and estimated the number of excess cancers due to exposure at 300 cancers per million adults[11]. Since most regulations are designed to limit excess cancers to one per million, this assessment put TDCPP's cancer hazard at 300 times the level considered acceptable.""",2
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","Naturally, I purchased this based on all the great reviews here. I love that after two solid months of use, the pillow is still in the same great shape it was in when I first got it. That's all due to the fact that this is solid foam; no way this is going to get all lumpy and out of shape any time soon! The cover is easy to take off and clean. I love the extra pocket! I can cram a burp rag and my Itzbeen timer in there quite easily. This is a big help when I have to bottle feed - this pillow makes it a one-hand operation and lets me eat, check my email, etc. while keeping my little one propped up at a proper angle.My reason for taking off a star is mainly that I'm a small chested woman and I barely went up a cup size after my milk came in. I don't think this pillow was really meant for women like me because my little one's head doesn't quite sit at the right angle for me to be completely ""hands free"" when I'm nursing my daughter. In fact, it doesn't help to position her head at all. I still need to actively situate her head and cradle her head in one arm during feeding. I think this is because the ""bumps"" in the pillow are too far away from my body/chest. However, I can still use the rest of the pillow to support the bulk of my daughter's body, so there's less stress on my shoulders and back.I'm not sure if it's just my pillow but sometimes the buckle is a bit tricky. It is NOT easy to fasten with just one hand.Given what I know now, I would still buy this. Although, probably used. It's helpful for bottle feeding.",4
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","I really wanted to love this product, and was hoping for a "" magic bullet"". I had a Boppy first, and used it in the hospital. I didn't like that Boppy came away from the body. My breast friend has some definite pros: it clasps around your body, and offers back support. It is fairly foolproof in the way the baby has to be positioned, so it might help moms who are new to breastfeeding. Cons: the pillow is rigid and is cumbersome and difficult to put on, especially if you are in bed, or after a c-section. It offers only one position breastfeeding. I like to  alternate the positions, like football and cross body hold, and am back to using Boppy.",3
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","I will never use a different breastfeeding pillow again and now that I have it I may die without it.  I had a different pillow and my son always slid around.  This one is perfect and keeps baby in perfect position, especially as a newborn.  I would even say you need to make sure you pack it for the hospital bag because that's when you'd need help with positioning the most.",5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst",I love this pillow.  It works way better than the boppy.  My only complaint is that the insides are made out of foam and you can't wash it.,5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","I bought mine through craigslist and it was very clean/good conition at a fraction of the price. That being said, I would have happily paid full retail for this nursing pillow, which has indeed become my breast friend. The strap feels secure and offers my aching postpartum back much needeed support. The pocket is priceless. I keep lanisoh, face wipes,Nosefrida The Snotsucker Nasal Aspirator,Itzbeen Baby Care Timer, Blue,nail clippers,WubbaNub Lamb, and a receiving blanket tucked in with still more room to spare.Although the boppy can be used as a pillow for your bum postpartum, thats about the only thing I wold use it for. I never cared for the design of the boppy and am so glad I found this. A must-have for me!",5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","I first purchased a My Brest Friend breastfeeding pillow when I had my 2nd child in 2012 - I actually had 2 of these nursing pillows so I didn't have to carry them all over the house. I LOVED them!  With #3 on the way, I was so excited to see this purple paisley color nursing pillow. I don't know if it's a new color or not, but I've certainly never seen it before! It arrived very quickly and I'm SO pleased with the paisley print in person - it's beautiful!Some personal background - I'm 5'1&#34; and pre-pregnancy hover around 100lbs.  I started using this nursing pillow immediately after coming home from the hospital with my 2nd child (I gained 26lbs during that pregnancy and fairly quickly lost the baby weight). From the very get-go, when using this pillow, I needed it pulled as tight as possible just to stay up on me. While my baby was a newborn, I was able to walk around the house and nurse fairly comfortably. As I lost more weight and baby gained more weight, however, I no longer was able to walk around nursing without physically holding the pillow up with both hands - otherwise it would slip right down. Not a big deal since I nursed while seated in the rocker or on the couch 95% of the time.  Overall - even if you're smaller framed, this nursing pillow would be a GREAT investment!  If I don't end up hanging onto this new purple paisley one after I'm done nursing baby #3, I certainly plan on purchasing yet another one for #4!",5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","I loved the concept of the pillow and how it made a level surface for nursing.  However, the pillow smelled like industrial glue.  Even after airing it out for a day it still smelled like glue. I have to return the pillow. When I took the cover off to air it out, I noticed that each of the pieces had been glued together.  I am trying to find a similar option without the glue smell because I liked it better than the boppy.",1
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","I had registered for the Boppy because that is the most commonly advertised breast feeding pillow, so naturally I assumed it was the best.  Not so! After many attempts to nurse hunched over with the pillow sliding all around and zero back support, I literally threw it across the room and sent my husband rushing to Babies R Us to get the Breast Friend ,10 minutes before the store closed because I NEEDED it immediately.  Nursing is difficult on it's own!  The last thing you need is a bad nursing pillow.  The Breast Friend is seriously wonderful!  I discovered it at the breast feeding class I attended at the hospital and there is a reason why they endorse it! Here are some things I love about it:**It clips around you so you can fit it around your body at the height that is most comfortable for you.  It prevented me from hunching over to try to reach the baby because the pillow didn't have to stay on my lap.**Since it clips on, you can walk around with it still attached which was a great plus for me!**I love that it provides back support.**The pillow is firm so the baby is supported where you need them to be.This is truly a great nursing pillow and I buy it as a gift for every baby shower I go to whether they registered for it or not!",5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","Despite all the glowing reviews for this nursing pillow, I hated it. First the clasp was NOT silent release. It sounded just like every other plastic buckle easily let out. But my baby has a huge startle reflex and the moment I gently released that buckle, boom, she was freaked out and awake. Plus the &#34;head rest&#34; bumps or whatever on the top of the pillow did not correlate well with me or my baby's needed positioning. And yes, I know what I'm doing. The back rest part I was very much looking forward too, but it was terribly uncomfortable and way too stiff of a surface. I don't have a recommendation for a pillow to get instead of this one unfortunately. I don't like the leachco I got either (for the exact opposite reasons...not stiff enough!). Perhaps it's time to try a Boppy.",1
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst",I gave this to my long time friend's daughter for a shower gift for her first child.  She loves being able to breastfeed her new born daughter comfortably and securely,5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst",Lived up to the great reviews - used while nursing at the hospital and continue to use at home. After having a C-section it helped hold my little one's weight without putting pressure on my ab muscles and scar. Highly recommend.,5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","I tried to save money by  not buying a BF pillow. Many moms and lactatiion consultant said it was unnecessary because a pillow would do the same. THEY ARE SO WRONG. Yeah saving money is nice but sometimes it's not worth saving that $30. I was struggling so much at the hospital because I was using a pillow. I thought it was just me not knowing how to BF my daughter because I'm  FTM. I had so much trouble latching her on and holding her in the proper position.THE FIRST TIME I used this I was like OH.MY.GOD. This is like a gift from the Gods of Breastfeeding Moms. I got her to latch on!!!! It was the best feeling ever!!!! I'm sure many moms out there know how frustrating it is to not be able to get LO to latch on. And then on top of that, getting all these aches and pains because you can't hold LO in the correct position. With this pillow, it's like the best thing ever!I got her to latch on and I was able to feed her comfortably. My back was at rest because I was able to sit up straight and not slouch to one side, or leaning forward. My arms are rested because I don't have to hold her in awkward positions. I was able to even play on my phone, go on FB or play games while feeding her at night.This pillow has made BF so enjoyable. I wished I had taken off from work longer so I was able to BF her from my breasts longer.I've tried with a Boppy before it's just not the same. Well, I MADE a Boppy because I wanted it to help LO sit up. And then I tried it out as a BF pillow. Doesn't work. She falls in to the middle. It was kind of annoying to figure out how to get LO in what position. I don't know. With the My Brest Friend I didn't have this problem. I just put LO on pillow and booby and it was done.",5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","Other reviews almost scared me away from purchasing this pillow and I am so glad I took the chance.  I had a Boppy with my first child and literally didn't use it because it was more of a hassle than a convenience but the My Brest Friend pillow is wonderful!  It definitely has an odor when you pull it out of the packaging but it goes away VERY quickly so it was a non-issue.  My newborn daughter latches and feeds much more comfortably when I'm using this pillow and that is a win-win.  She'll nurse without it, but I find it to be a lot more convenient and comfortable when I am using it.  Overall, I am extremely happy with this purchase.",5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","This pillow makes nursing sooooo easy.  You can keep the vitamin d drops in the little pocket, which is convenient!  We love it.  I am excited to take it on our looong plane trip together because she can just use it as a bed on my lap while I watch an in-flight movie. The really ugly design, coupled with the covers that clearly have not had a design change since the 70s shows you that the makers of this product haven't had to try very hard to keep people buying this pillow, because it's just great. You should get an extra cover.",5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","I placed this on the registry for my second child. Positioning this pillow was awkward due to a combination of its firmness and shape, leading me to have horrid nipple blisters and bleeding. It took me a few days to wonder through the daze of newborn-related sleeplessness if the problems I was experiencing were related not to my baby but to the pillow itself. I stopped using the pillow and found immediate relief using a combination of arm and bed pillow support in lieu of this pillow.I just picked up a much more comfortable, versatile alternative--the same kind I used for two years nursing my first child--from a nearby hospital-but regrettably can't recommend it since it has no brand information.",1
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst",It seems like a good design but I honestly found that a blanket was a lot easier for positioning my baby for nursing rather than a nursing pillow. I have this and a bobby and I don't use either one.,3
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","This is a nice design with support for the baby's head and the strap to hold the pillow in place. It's not the best quality though with a piece of foam and a rather thin quality cover. Took many washes to get the smell off the pillow. The price is a scam though, which has a wide range ($20 - $40) depending on the cover! Watch out for it. I don't think it's worth 20 either, but oh well.",3
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst",very yeasy to use. nothing like it. you will never regret buying it. Great for fist time mom. It's  yours to use,5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","I guess this just wasn't for me.  After reading all the fab reviews, I decided to get this instead of a Boppy.  It was good for a little while and I appreciated the support for the baby and my back but since you have to get it wrapped around you and then settled (while your baby screams), it isn't as easy to use as a Boppy. Plus after about 2 months, it was just easier to skip it and it has been in the closet ever since.  At least with a Boppy, you can use it for other things as your child grows and sits up, etc.  This had such a short useful life and is such a big thing to store, it just wasn't worth it.",3
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","I got this for WAY cheaper than in the brick-and-mortar store where I registered, so I had to scoop it up. I already had a Boppy, but I had read great things about the. My Breast Friend too.Ultimately, breastfeeding didn't last for us (tried with no luck for several months and then switched to exclusively pumping for a year). I did use it many times while I tried nursing and I did like it in general. I like that you could strap it on, so it wouldn't really move. It was also a bit more firm and flat than the Boppy and that did seem to work better for us when nursing &#34;almost&#34; worked.I did also like the pocket, which was nice to keep small items in like my nipple shield and case so it as close at hand.The only thing I wasn't a fan of was how cumbersome it was when I did have to sit down, but the baby down in the bassinet or swing, strap on the pillow, then try and nurse. It just took a while, which was annoying when breastfeeding was already frustrating.I'm hoping to get much more use out if and when we have baby #2! :)",3
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","I had one of these with my firstborn son but wanted a different print for my soon to be daughter.  I LOVE this print, absolutely gorgeous lavender.  Goes with my daughters nursery theme perfectly.  These pillows truly are the best, breastfeeding or not it makes holding baby for feedings so much more comfy.  Quick shipment but hate ups lack of customer service.  Left package outside at gate rather than just bringing it to my front door, yes gate was left open.  They are lazy.  Amazon should switch to fed ex.",5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","First of all, this is the only nursing pillow I own, so I can't compare it to any of the others. I will say it works much better than regular bed pillows. It has just the right firmness and the perfect shape for the baby to rest comfortably. It's not only for cradle position, either: turn it over so the flat side is up, and position it on your side and it's great for football/clutch hold. I find wedging a regular pillow underneath gives even more support. I recommend buying an extra cover so you always have one to use when the other is being washed. By the way, I've used mine for three months and washed it several times and with the exception of a very small tear in the fabric, it's held up great. Very well worth the $20-something you pay for it.",5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","Oy! what expecting mom wants to receive a breastfeeding pillow that gives off toxic odors?? This product is not safe. Like other reviewers pointed out, it has discoloration and glue on the actual pillow, and it smells absolutely horrible. I took it outside, and my living room still smells even though it was only here for half an hour. DO NOT BUY.",1
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst",I borrowed one from a lactation consultant and didn't want to give it back!  This eased the frustration of nursing a new baby.  Easy to clean and the level surface kept the baby from ""falling"" into the gap (which was the case of using a pillow).,5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","My friend bought me this pillow as a gift.  I was so sad to report to her that when I opened the package, the stench of industrial chemicals almost knocked me out.  Upon further investigation (googling it and seeing other reviewers) I see why...this pillow is full of toxic chemicals. If you take off the cover, you can see that it the foam glued together with some gloppy, stinky, yellow gunk. I can't believe it is even legal to have this thing near a baby! What is this world coming to.",1
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","I was so glad I had this for my newborn! I use the boppy mainly now for my older baby (or just a pillow), but I used this Brest Friend exclusively for the first two months. It creates such a nice stable platform for holding the baby and I love the little head support bumps. Getting the hang of breastfeeding was so tiring and frustrating at first, and this support pillow really made my life easier.",5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst",This is positively the best and only support system a nursing mother needs. Your baby will love it and so will you!!,5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst",Breast feeding at every hour is not easy.  My baby girl wakes up at any hour and when I am tired is hard to maintain posture...also my back and shoulders were killing me! I was desperate and this pillow save my life!! I used it all the time! My husband use it too!!!,5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst",I am so happy I found this! This is really useful for those late night feedings because a normal Boppy slides around and you have to reposition it every time you move. Not this one! It stays put and I highly recommend it for anyone nursing their little one.,5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","Pros:--firm surface supports baby well--strap and buckle to keep it on = hands free--back support--wide flat feeding surfaceCons:--VERY cheap materials.--fabric is not nice at all compared to Boppy covers. Mine has uneven dye spots and marks that shouldn't have passed quality control. One of the seams ripped and the zipper popped apart, and I don't even use it constantly!--foam gives off an odor. Makes you not want to have your baby on it breathing its fumes.Good concept but shoddily executed. In hindsight I wouldn't have gotten this pillow if I could have seen it before buying.",3
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","Great quality product although, I couldnt use it since my baby wouldnt latch.  I would recommend waiting until you have the baby just in case becuase they are pretty expesive but other than that NO COMPLAINTS.",5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst",I buy this for all my baby shower gifts.  This pillow is more firm than any other pillow to breast feed.,5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst",I just love this nursing pillow. I was recommended to use this pillow at the breatfeeding class. This is so lightweight and it gives a perfect fit around your waist. I dont have any shoulder pain or neck pain after using this pillow. Also you can turn it around to position your baby to feed in the football position. the baby stays in good position while feeding in the cradle and cross cradle position. breast feeding would have been a hard job without this pillow.,5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst",I didn't use this product as much as I thought I would.  I am a first time mother and I thought it would be difficult to position my baby for breastfeeding.  I didn't have as much trouble as I thought.  I only used it for the first few weeks after coming home from the hospital and that was it.  It is to much trouble to strap on every time you feed your baby.  If I had to do it over again I wouldn't buy this item.  I hardly used it and it was not worth the money.,2
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","Both work well, but the Boppy leaves a gap between the pillow and the baby, which I'd been filling with towels to prop the baby up. It also put a lot of pressure on the nether region, which was very sore post delivery. Because the My Brest Friend is flat and firm and can be fastened higher up, it alleviated the pressure on the nether region, which I firmly believe helped me heal.",5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","After trying the Boppy and having huge difficulties with latching & breastfeeding & seeing lactation consultants, this Brest Friend pillow made such a huge difference!  It allows proper positioning, alignment, and baby even falls asleep on it afterwards.  The lactation consultant agreed that THIS is the pillow to get, the Boppy is horrible.  Definitely a must have for all nursing new mothers!",5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","I have to admit that the reason I bought it was because I heard that Mrs. Duggar uses it and I figured she has a lot of experience in this area so I decided I would try it with my 6th child.  I have a &#34;deluxe&#34; cloud boppy and have used it with some of my kids, although with others it wasn't that useful (I prefer to have baby on by arm and control the angle vs baby on a pillow).Sitting in bed:Anyways, I was super excited to  try this pillow out, but it was very uncomfortable to use sitting down, since it has that part on my back.  I actually just used it once sitting in bed, and then it was so uncomfortable, that I did not use it again in bed.Standing:I would never use it as the only support for my baby standing, but I used it while walking (I still used my arm for support, but it did take off from the weight). Now, I find it uncomfortable to sit with back support while wearing this, so it was kind of pointless to use it to walk and then have to take it off again to sit down.I am surprised this has such a great rating, honestly!",2
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","This was a great pillow when I was breastfeeding my daughter. I love the pocket too! I kept the remote, nipple wipes and a pacifier in there. The cover is easy to remove and wash. After a couple of washes it will lightly fade but still does it's job. Cute design and color! Way better than the boppy.",5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","This item was a good buy.  After reading all the reviews, I made the decision to try it out.  I am a breastfeeding mommy, and this pillow comes in handy.  It eases the strain of holding the baby while breastfeeding every couple of hours, and even helps him latch on easier.  My husband can even use the pillow when bottle feeding.  I would recommend.  Not a necessity, but definitely a helper!",5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst",I just love this breast feeding pillow. It is easy to use & very comfortable to use.  The baby is positioned perfectly.  The fabric stays cool.,5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst",Great back support and placement for baby. I ended up just side-lying mostly but would reccommend this if you can't or dont want to side-lie in the early days,4
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","I love this pillow and have used it every day since I brought my daughter home from the hospital 6 weeks ago. The surface is well cushioned and has two raised ""bumps"" that tilt and elevate her head to make nursing easier on us both. She falls asleep on it all the time and I can let her sleep there until I have to get up or she wakes up.She is an all day nurser, so I use this at the computer so I can type and get things done online while she is nursing. It is sturdy when you buckle it on, and it's easy to adjust. I use the pocket for ointments and they stay in the pocket, even when I toss the pillow around.My only complaints are very small ones. When I washed the cover it was kind of difficult to get back on the pillow, and when my daughter is nursing on my left side her feet hang over the right edge and the strap leaves a red line on her leg. I've thought of making a fleece wrap to cover the strap and solve that problem. Overall a great purchase, I'm so glad I chose this over the crescent shaped pillows that just sit on your lap!EDIT: I used this pillow daily with my daughter until she was about 6 months old, although she is a skinny baby she is tall and this worked well until she outgrew it. Now it's being stored for the next baby! I would HIGHLY recommend this pillow to any nursing mom.",5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","It rely is my Brest friend! I've been using this since I came home with the baby and I can do so much with it including typing on my iPad, ta on he phone etc and my baby is super comfy! Love love it!!!",5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","I recently bought this product for my 2 month old baby.  I already had the Bobby Pillow which is perfect for when I sit in my Glider Rocker; however, I did not like using the Bobby Pillow other than in that one chair.  The bobby pillow will shift out of position if you aren't sitting in a chair that will brace the sides of the bobby pillow.  This pillow holds the baby right in position, and if I need to temporariliy stand up while nursing the baby, the pillow stays in position.  This is perfect when I have to attend to my 2 year old daughter.  I like taking this pillow to other people's houses too because, I can sit on a sofa, a kitchen chair, a lawn chair, etc with a Nursing Cover.. and still nurse the baby comfortably where I never could do this before.  I found I can use this pillow while reclining on the sofa because even when I lean back, this pillow stays upright and still holds the baby up to my brest.  Wish I would have gotten this sooner.  For my first child, since I already had the Bobby, I thought this pillow was unnecessary.  I love the freedom and versatility this pillow provides.  So, I recommend owning BOTH Brest Friend and Bobby Pillow for comfortably brestfeeding.  (I even started exploring breast feeding in a Sleepy Wrap.)  To be successful at brestfeeding your second child, you need to have the freedom to move around so you can still take care of and enjoy your older child at the same time.",4
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","absolutely amazing, completely worth the money! it is sooooo much more comfortable and very easy to use, i definitely recommend this product!",5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","I received a boppy at my baby shower and I used it when my son was a newborn. After a couple weeks it got flatter and flatter as he got bigger. I started slouching to feed him and had horrible upper back pains and poor posture as a result. I decided to buy the Brest Friend and I am so glad I did! The back support is awesome and I am 100x more comfortable nursing now, especially in the middle of the night. Yes, it's not cheap, but when it comes to your health $40 is not a lot to spend!!!",5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","Let me start by saying that if you're pregnant and thinking that buying a nursing pillow is a splurge and that maybe you won't need it, consider this: you'll be spending most of your day (and night) breastfeeding for the first couple of weeks and at least a third of your day later on. You'll feel like you're nursing ALL THE TIME and that can be overwhelming, so prepare yourself to watch whole seasons of shows at a time and buy a nursing pillow. Or two. Anything that will make it a more comfortable and positive experience.I got both a Boppy and MBF. My research online suggested that MBF is amazing and better than Boppy. After 3 months of using both, I have to say that I liked MBF at the beginning when my son was still very little but now prefer a Boppy.MBF pros: stiffer than Boppy, easier to position a wiggly baby on, provides back support, helpful with learning how to latch properly by the way it's designed (both for mom and baby) and you can technically move around while nursing but I don't recommend it - baby can fall.MBF cons: big and stiff - difficult to use in some chairs, Boppy is easier to squish and adjust, cover is difficult to take off and put back on, cover fabric is  cheap, not great for babies older than 4-6 weeks (also, once you get the ins and outs of breastfeeding and both you and baby know what you're doing, you won't necessarily need the stiff support). Also, I didn't like using MBF in bed at night as it takes a while to put on and is not very comfortable in the back section when you're leaning on pillows half asleep.If you want to buy one nursing pillow, I would invest in a Boppy. It's more versatile, easier to care for and can be used for different purposes than breastfeeding later on, like tummy time, supported sitting or just hanging out. MBF can only be used for breastfeeding.",4
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","My friend suggested this pillow to me and I am glad she did. It really takes the pressure off my hands and my son is really comfortable while lying on it for feedings. I like the fact that it's cover can be taken off and washed. However, one minor issue that I face with it is it bends too much from the right side and is not absolutely leveled. While feeding I have3 to specially lift my right leg upwards to level the pillow horizontally.All in all, it is definitely a product that I would recommend to people.",4
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst",I got both this pillow and the boppie pillow.  The Brest Friend is MUCH easier to use.  Baby doesn't slip off of it as easily and it provides more back support.,5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","I was using a five year old boppy for my two week old son who had a posterior tongue-tied, after visiting my pediatrician she had me nurse my son with the brest friend pillow. What an amazing product. When I got home I immediately went online and purchase this for myself. It really makes for a feeding more comfortable, and it's more convenient especially played with two other children. My son is much more comfortable, relaxed, and secure with this pillow versus the boppy. It's a must-have. My only complaint is that the case doesn't stay exactly properly fitted to the pillow itself it pulls up a little bit but not bad.",4
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","I received the My Breast Friend pillow as a shower gift. I intended on using it a lot as many of the mom's I knew swore by it. However, when I had my daughter and started to use it, I found it cumbersome and not very convenient. I ended up using pillows and then eventually nothing. For me, it's one of those things that seemed great, but ended up being unnecessary. Therefore, because of the price, I would recommend borrowing one from a friend if you can especially because if you do end up using it, it will probably only be for a few months.",3
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst",my wife uses this pillow for nursing and its very comfortable. good color options as well. product arrived in great packaging.  highly recommend it.,5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","I tried the boppy which you can find everywhere, but wasn't satisfied with how my baby would roll forward or backward when I tried to breastfeed.  The brest friend is mostly flat, plus stays secure around my waist, so my baby is perfectly positioned while feeding.  I end up wearing it (and my baby) around the house a lot of the day.  It's one of the few things I would refuse to go without.",5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","I bought this because I think baby ""stuff"" (stroller, swings, bouncers, etc.) takes up so much storage space and I liked the idea of folding it up to store after the baby was passed the nursing stage, plus it had good reviews.I actually think it works well for nursing, although my husband liked to laugh at me calling it my ""life preserver"" when I'd stand up afterwards and it was still connected around my waist.The biggest problem is that the air doesn't stay for long periods of time. We had to blow it up every week or two as the air slowly seeped out. And at just one month it mysteriously got a bigger leak in the middle of the night and went mostly flat. I guess I could have repaired the leak and continued using it, but by then, I was just in the mood to buy a Boppy and stop having to worry about blowing it up. Perhaps this nursing pillow should just be used for travel and not everyday use.On the pros side, once when my son had a blow out in his diaper, I just had to worry about washing the cover and I didn't need to worry about any of the mess seeping through to the pillow.",3
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","While I like how firm the pillow is, I really don't like that it wraps all the way around the back.  It makes sitting uncomfortable--I can't sit all the way back in the chair.  Not being comfortable during the middle of the night feedings is not my cup of tea.  I really wish they had a version that didn't go all the way around.  Also, it's a bit cumbersome to wrap it around while holding a crying baby.",4
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","I had a hard time figuring out how to get my daughter comfortable and nurse when she was born, until my husband came home with ""my brest friend nursing pillow"".  It made nursing so much easier.  My daughter is weaning herself now, but she was able to use the pillow for a little over a year.  This pillow worked for me, despite the fact that when I started I was significantly overweight.  As I lost the excess weight, I was able to tighten the pillow into a secure fit.I love the fact that the pillow cover is removable, so that you can wash it.  I love the pocket to hold burp rags (or TV remotes).",5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","Great for infancy, especially before the baby has neck control. Eventually,as the baby grew, I figured out that the cradle hold was all baby & I needed. I like that this nursing pillow straps on & does not move away from my body. Additionally, the removable washable cover was great & washed frequently with spit ups.",4
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","This was a shower gift for my daughter-in-law, something she specifically asked for.  My daughter also has one, and both girls LOVE them!",5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","It was already tough not to have my parents, nor any extra help, when we had our firstborn, so much more due to the difficulties and challenges of breastfeeding. But I was persistent and well certain that I didn't want anything else for my baby but breast milk. With no one to teach me, my husband and I went down to see our LC and she taught us how to breastfeed using this pillow. Oh, it was heaven sent! We went back home with much delight! I was able to put baby comfortably in the cradle, cross-cradle position, and football hold. Baby was comfortable to stay in position and that helped a lot with his latching on (and staying latched on). I was all comfortable, as well! We were able to breastfeed successfully since then. This is now our 5th month and going strong. I highly recommend this product to all mummies out there. I'm now getting one for my cousin who is due this month!",5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst",I love love love this product!  My newborn feeds all the time and this is such an easy way to hold and feed her. Keeps my arms from getting tired and the pocket is nice for storing her binky. Highly recommend to anyone!!,5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","When you first start breastfeeding, latching the baby on is a production.  This pillow actually worked well with what it was designed to do-it makes it much easier to get the baby latched on properly.  It's just a production in and of itself to use the thing.  I wonder about people who swear by the convenience of this product, because I just couldn't understand a few key things.  It's huge, where do you store it while you are not nursing?  I kept it in my bedroom but if I wasn't nursing in there...Do you detach and reattach it every time you breastfeed?  When I became a little more familiar with the process of breastfeeding (after about 2 weeks) I threw it on top of the pile of maternity clothes I will end up donating.  It just wasn't worth my time and energy to go get the pillow, attach the pillow to me and then get the baby on.  I don't think I would spend 30 something dollars on it if I had it to do over again. She is almost 3 months old and I use a regular bed pillow for support now... much easier.",2
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","I love the velcro strap, which keeps the pillow in place while nursing. I have also used a Bobby pillow and it kept shifting, which was really annoying. One of the better purchases I made (as a first time mom). I would definitely recommend this product and buy it again.",5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","Best pillow I have ever used! Baby doesn't slip or slide, just held in the perfect spot. Great back support and almost hands free nursing. It has held up really well after nursing two kiddos. Still looks new and I have no doubt it will last for another! This should be on the must have list for every new mom.",5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","My son was a sloooooooooooow eater for the first few months.  He would nurse for 1.5 hours at a time, every 3-4 hours.  He basically lived on my boobs.  Luckily, once he really got the hang of latching on (after the first week or two), I found that I could lay him on ""My Brest Friend"", wedge a small throw pillow under ""My Brest Friend"" to keep the baby at the right height (the strap holds the pillow roughly in the right place, but not quite well enough for 'freehanding' it), get the baby latched on, then use my hands to do all kind of things: Eat, use the computer, write thank-you cards, etc.  If not for this pillow and the ability to multitask while marathon nursing, I can't imagine that I would have nursed him as long as I have.  He's currently 7 months, and these days usually breastfeeds in only 10-15 minutes, but I still often place him on the pillow to nurse if I want to use those minutes to get a little work done on the computer or scarf down some food with two hands.  Love, love, love it!",5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","As a new mom and new to breastfeeding, I bought this after hearing how much better it was for breastfeeding than the Boppy, (which I had also already bought), especially for newborns. baby and I did great breastfeeding in the hospital when we were just using pillows (that was more convenient than using the my breast friend pillow).. however, after a while when we were home we started having some issues - he was fussy, kept moving, wouldn't latch on, I spent several nights frustrated, until I put him on a regular pillow.. My Breast Friend must be uncomfortable for him. it's nice and hard and it was easy for me to get him in a good position, but unfortunately, baby doesn't like it! so, yet another product that has ended up collecting dust.",3
My Brest Friend Navy Spiral Pillow,"I tried this pillow while nursing my twins, hoping it would make things easier. I used it for about a week before switching back to the boppy. I felt this pillow was really expensive and it was so big. I had a hard time getting ready and adjusting. I was much more successful popping the boppy on to my lap and then double nursing the twins.",2
Bright Starts Drop &amp; Giggle,This is one of my sons favorite toy! He's 12 months old. I bought it a few months ago for Christmas and he absolutely loves it! Great toy,5
Bright Starts Drop &amp; Giggle,Very very very nice toy. I presented it for my friend's daughter. she loves it. Good toy for such price,5
Bright Starts Drop &amp; Giggle,"This item arrived and the sound does not work at all.  We replaced the batteries that came with it with fresh batteries and it still does not work at all.  Also, it only comes with 3 balls, not the 4 that are advertised.  Useless, and now I have to either consider the money flushed down the toilet or go through a big hassle to try to return it.  Very disappointed.",1
Bright Starts Drop &amp; Giggle,"My toddler loves this toy, he plays with it all the time.  He regularly throws it around and whacks the balls together - it has handled all the attention he can throw at it and still looks brand new.  It's great for solo play or to share with a little friend.  My only wish is that extra balls were sold separately - the ones included often go missing.",5
Bright Starts Drop &amp; Giggle,"It is a great product. good packaging, good price,absolutely, I recommend it. . . . . . . . .",5
Bright Starts Drop &amp; Giggle,"This was a toy for my 7 month old granddaugher.  She was able to try to put the balls in and her older brother (2) and sister (4) were intrigued enough to sit and &#34;help&#34; her play with it.  Looks sturdy, so I'm happy.",5
Bright Starts Drop &amp; Giggle,"Perfect toy! Not too high tech like everything else is. Very basic, drop it in one of the holes, it comes out. Repeat. My daughter loves it! With all the new stuff out there, it's nice for her to have something so basic, she knows what's going to happen next and will sit and play with it for a long time.",5
Bright Starts Drop &amp; Giggle,"My son absolutely loves this toy. Many holes, so it allows me to play with him as well.",5
Bright Starts Drop &amp; Giggle,Kids that can crawl and pick up the Bright Starts balls love this colorful toy.  Doesn't take up much room and provides good educational entertainment while building coordination skills.,5
Bright Starts Drop &amp; Giggle,Good toy for 8-16 months.  My little guy loves the balls and dropping them in over and over.  It's a storage option is nice to keep the balls together.,5
Bright Starts Drop &amp; Giggle,"My son loves this toy it could be a little more durable but that is my only complaint. Mine is not broken but it was made cheaply, cheap plastic. But if my son loves it I would have to say I would buy it again.",4
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Blue","I love this pillow!  I had a boppy at first, and decided to try this pillow.  I'm so glad I did.  This is so much easier to use and more comfortable for me and the baby.  I can actually sit up in bed and use this pillow, which was great when we were still working on the latch, etc.  This pillow is definitely worth the $!",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Blue",This pillow is so much better than the boppy which I used with my first son.  Now with my second son I use the breast friend pillow and love it.  Only complait is that it is a pain to fasten and unfasten but it really helps it stay in place which makes it worth the few extra seconds!,4
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Blue","After pain in my neck, back and arms, sweaty baby, sweaty me and frustration, pillows under my arms, under the baby, behind me. Brest friend came along to save us. A baby can lie down on the pillow, it has a special raised pad for his head on both sides to fit perfectly for facing a breast. The material is soft and washable, doesn't shrink in the dryer. A nice pocket fits a diaper, wet wipes and a pacifier. The color of this blue brest friend is light blue, not as bright blue as on the picture here. I liked its actual light blue color. The back pad on the brest friend envelops around my back and it all feels comfy to brestfeed using this product.",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Blue","I LOVE this pillow. Most amazing breast-feeding aid ever! Doesn't kill my back and is comfy for baby. Beware of the color. It seems on the page that you will be purchasing an aqua colored pillow. It actually is light blue, which I don't mind but was a bit disappointed. I was hoping for the exact color as the picture displayed. Overall, great purchase!",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Blue","We started out using a boppy, but then a friend told us about the Brest Friend and we realized that our baby didn't need to slip down whenever my wife nurses our son, and she was also really happy about the back support, so I immediately went onto Amazon and ordered one, and she's been happy with it ever since.",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Blue","Bought three, take it everywhere with me.  It really is my &#34;Breast friend&#34;  and my &#34;Best Friend&#34;! Works amazing for breastfeeding.",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Blue","For the short duration my baby actually fed from my breast (4 weeks)...he seemed pretty comfortable on this. Still, kind of hurt balancing this on my belly after a c-section.",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Blue","I tried using the boppy pillow.  Our boy couldn't lay straight with my breast.  And his body was sinking on each side.  We had to prop pillows under both sides.  We went to our lactation consultant appointment at our pediatrician and this is the pillow that they used.  Our boy laid perfectly with my breast and man it was so much easier to nurse!  Our lactation consultant even told me that the boppy pillow was NEVER designed to be a nursing pillow but they advertise it as one.  This pillow was specifically designed for nursing.  At the beginning I didn't think that nursing was going to work for me, but after going in for my lactation consultant appointment I was taught how to properly latch my baby on and I had found the proper pillow to use to make it easier on my boy and myself. We have a My Brest Friend for home and one in the car for on the go.  I have now been successfully nursing for going on 9 months now.  Please do not buy the Boppy.",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Blue","Bulky, annoying, wasn't really useful.. just propping my arms on armrest while nursing baby worked better. Hard to hold in a way to keep baby in a more upright position (better for digestion).",1
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Blue",I ordered this for my new baby girl and the color arrived and it's a very pale blue and not alike the turquoise blue shown in the photo.  Perfect for a boy but was too &#34;boyish&#34; for me for my girl.  I was surprised not to see many reviews stating it's the wrong color.  I am exchanging for a new lilac one as we're trying to shy away from so much pink.,3
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Blue",I just love this breastfeeding pillow.  I had so much trouble keeping the boppy pillow next to my body.  The boppy just didn't support my baby enough causing me to have bad posture.  This pillow has made breastfeeding my little girl so much easier.  No more back pain.  Wish I had bought this pillow sooner!  Also love the pocket!  Use it to hold my cell phone and pacifiers.  This also keeps these items out of sight of my 17 month old.,5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Blue","I ended up with an emergency C-section, and I can't imagine how I would have been able to successfully breastfeed for the first time without the aid of this pillow. It helped me position baby correctly from the very start and therefore avoid extreme breast soreness. I was even able to walk around with the baby sleeping on the pillow. The front pocket proved perfect for carrying around my water bottle, so I could stay hydrated while nursing. Baby LOVED it from the very start, both to nurse and to sleep on. He is now two months old and still takes at least one of his daily naps on the pillow in my lap after he's finished nursing (very convenient for having some quiet time to work on the computer, as right now :D)! When he's upset and we have to go out, I lull him to sleep nursing on the pillow and can then carry him out to the car on it. I hope they start selling this pillow in Eastern Europe soon (where I live), so more of my mom friends could benefit from using it (I was blessed to have it brought over to me from the USA). The only minor thing that annoys me is that because I have a small waist, the end of the velcro belt hangs loose (unattached) from the pillow and tends to get stuck on the fuzzy blankie I cover the baby with while he's laying on the pillow. I ordered an extra cover for the pillow (this time in brown), and they seem to have fixed this issue somewhat, so not as much of the belt hangs loose...",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Blue","This has been my saving grace while exclusively nursing my son. Makes everything immeasurably easier, is comfy, not bulky, and easy to wash. The pocket is a nice touch as well :)So worth it! I can't recommend it enough!!",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Blue","I bought this for my cousin and she bought one for me, it's cute and exactly what I thought it would be",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Blue","I breast fed with my first child and I had the Boppy.  I thought the boppy was good.  But when i saw this it looked even better.  I thought, if I don't like it, I can return it.  It is wonderful!  I am so glad I made the investment.  You will have much more flexibility in positioning and comfort with this vs. the boppy!",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Blue","I am sooo happy that I bought this pillow!!  I love that I can buckle it on to myself, unlike the Boppy.  When my son was younger, I was able to (carefully) lay him on there and carry him with me to the kitchen or bathroom while i was feeding him.  My son is almost 6 months old and we are still using it every day.  Hes a little long for it, but we manage. We use it for eating and for just hanging out on my lap. Another plus is that you can take the cover off and wash it.  The cover is easy to put back on after a little practice.  I am so in love with this pillow! I recommend it to all the women I see in the Bobby department at Babies R Us.  I don't know what I'm going to do when he gets older/bigger, I don't want to retire it!",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Blue","I purchased the Boppy BEFORE I had my baby and thought that the Boppy would be the practical purchase as I could use it to breastfeed and then as a pillow for baby to sit in when she was older. The Boppy was the worst for breastfeeding. I went to a lactation specialist and used the Brest Friend. Wow, it so much easier and better to nurse with than the Boppy. The BF didn't slide around and create gaps between me and the pillow. Baby was at the correct height for breast feeding and it was easier to move her around on.The only negative I have about the BF is the cover. The soft fabric makes me sweat a lot (I live in a warmer climate)! I was going to order a cotton cover but I read reviews that the cotton material is thin and fluids (breast milk, potty and spit up!) will easily soak through the cover and into the foam material. If that happens then you have a smelly BF and I don't want to strap that onto me every few hours if it stinks.I would recommend this to other mothers before I would recommend the Boppy.",4
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Blue","I have 9 children and really wanted to get away from the average uncomfortable pillow when feeding. I decided to try this pillow because of all the great ratings it had and really wanted to love love love this pillow. I finally had it delivered and was so so excited to have this work, however, once I opened it from the plastic cover, I immediately smelled a strong chemical smell. I tried to ignore it but it eventually gave me one nasty headache and made my baby very irritable! I returned it thinking that maybe mine was defective and bought another, same thing. I think it has to do with the flame retardant spray they use, (according to the company when I called) so I said, wow then why are you thinking of another alternative since babies are resting their pure little heads on this? She could not give me an answer. So I am back to my regular pillows and boppys! Please do your research! This pillow is a major hazard, the idea of it was amazing and the fit was great but I would not lay my baby in tide detergent and let him nap, nor would I lay my baby on sprayed chemicals that will hurt his lungs and respiratory system. If anyone has any ideas on a good eco breastfeeding cover that is safe for human lungs, please please respond to me:) Thank you!",1
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Blue","I like the product and am using both the boppy and this one.  I noticed this one is better for your back, good for infants, and keeps baby in straight line while feeding.  The velcro strap is so loud and wakes up my baby a lot - I have to set baby down and go into another room to take off, especially at night when you nurse them to sleep.  Also, good for infants once baby can move / turn it may pose a safety risk because its so hard surfaced there is no give, she may fall off your lap (?) This hasn't happened and my baby is only 3 weeks but something to think about.  Again I have the boppy too for night feedings (velcro!!).UPDATE - My infant is older (3.5 months) I think this is safer and easier to use now. Also, I must have had ""baby brain"" because YES you can use the clip and not the velcro.... updating to give this more stars. I LOVE it.",4
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green","I originally had the Boppy since everyone had it, I had never heard of this pillow until I saw a lactation consultant frustrated with how nursing my baby was going.  She had this pillow in her office and I've been using it ever since.  This pillow stays up where the boppy starts to droop, which hour upon hour of nursing this helps your back.  More people who are set on nursing need to buy this pillow to help with breastfeeding.  If you see someone registered for the boppy buy this instead!",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green","I used a Boppy for the first 10 weeks after my son was born until I finally found the My Brest Friend deluxe pillow.  With the Boppy, I had trouble with getting myself and the baby into the right position for nursing.  It seemed like he was always sliding down between me and the pillow and I had to sit up at an awkward angle that often gave me a backache.When I switched to the My Brest Friend, our breastfeeding experience drastically improved.  The flat surface was much more comfortable for the baby and I love the back support of the Brest Friend.  He stays latched on much better and I have more freedom in where I can nurse comfortably (no longer needing a back support).While I love the Brest Friend, it does have some drawbacks.  It is definitely more cumbersome to put on if you are already holding the baby.  Also, if you're like me and have a baby that spits up a lot or an overactive let-down, this pillow is harder to clean than the Boppy.  The washing instructions say to hang-dry the cover (which is somewhat of a pain to put back on after washing), though I've put it in the dryer on low for short times and seen no negative effects.  My solution is to put a folded receiving blanket over the pillow to keep from having to wash it so often.I do still use my Boppy for lots of other things, such as propping up the baby and for his tummy time.  It's also easier to travel with and feed in the parked car than the Brest Friend.  If you already have a Boppy or have the option to purchase both, I would recommend having one of each.  But if you only get one nursing pillow, get the My Brest Friend.",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green","Despite having a horrible name, the My Breast Friend is incredibly helpful for breastfeeding Moms. It is a life saver (and a back saver!). The cover is soft for the baby (although why they chose light lime green, I'll never understand) and the pocket is roomy enough for a burp cloth and cell phone. I even bought the travel version for my trips, which was useful but this one is by far the most sturdy and comfortable. I can't recommend it more highly.",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green","I agree with most of the pros and cons other reviewers have written. I really like using this to feed my baby; I don't use it every time but I like it for when I need a free hand. My biggest complaint is that it is tough to put on with one hand, but I just put baby down for a second and we're all set to go.",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green","This thing just saved my back, my boobs and my sanity!  After 2 month of struggling with Boppies, I am grateful.",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green","For my baby's latching problems and my overactive letdown, this was the only solution that worked for me.  It puts baby in the perfect relaxed body position so you can lean back, manipulate him with both hands, and keep pressure on his back properly during difficult feedings.  The pocket is really handy for my water bottle when I get dehydrated while nursing and the silent clip was great for moving the baby without waking him if he fell asleep.",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green","On my second child I longed for more one-arm-free nursing. I have been using the Boppy prior to this. After a c section I thought this pillow would be helpful however I found the pressure from having to strap it on uncomfortable fir the ehole first month. Also I had become accustomed to having an arm support my baby while nursing and the design of this pillow doesn't work that way, your arm is to be a support over top of the baby. Nothing uncomfy but foreign to me and I don't like this pillow for that reason. I feel less close to my baby when using this. I prefer to hold my baby in my arm and support with a pillow. This functions to hold with a pillow and support with your arm. I wanted more freedom to move around while nursing but find using no pillow when moving to still be easier.In addition I enjoy using the boppy as a baby positioner, holding baby inclined after a feed to promote burping. I can't see how this pillow can do that.Good design, firm pillow, however if you've used a Boppy this may just be too foreign.",3
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green","This has been a true lifesaver (or back-saver really) in the early days of breastfeeding. My son is now 7 weeks old and we have used this all day and night since he was born. I actually have had to teach myself to nurse without it!Definitely get it over the boppy, it is fantastic!Oh, and a couple tips! I recommend getting 2 covers, one for having on the pillow, and one for washing (since it needs to air dry). I also put burp cloths (we use the white prefold diapers) underneath the cover, to protect the pillow from blowouts and spit ups :)",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green",Our baby loves the cushion and easily makes herself comfortable during feedings.  She even falls asleep right on the pillow!,5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green","I first saw this pillow in the baby store when my husband and I went to register for our baby shower.  I have to admit, at first glance I thought, ""Well that seems a little too involved...""  The only pillow I'd ever seen anyone with was one of the U-shaped ones (i.e. a Boppy type pillow) so we picked one of those instead.  Skip ahead a few months:  our sweet son was born and I was having a lot of issues with trying to nurse him the first few weeks.  A lactation consultant came to my house to help and brought one of these pillows with her.  She strapped it on me and after about five minutes of tweaking some of my positioning, my son latched on properly!  I was ecstatic and went the very next day to get one for myself!Have used it ever since and have not had any more difficulty or issue with nursing.  The pillow securely straps on and has a flat surface (with a slight raise where the baby's head goes) so that the baby will not shift or roll should you change positions.  Not only does it provide great back support, but it is also possible to get up and walk around while still nursing- something I think I'll appreciate more one day when we have more children who need my attention hehe.  The first few months I took this pillow with me wherever I went; it has a strap so it attaches right onto the stroller when out and about.  Can't say enough good things about it (obviously!).  I HIGHLY recommend getting one to aid with breast-feeding.  On a side note we also used this to help my son with sitting up on his own; we would sit him in the middle with the strap snapped together.  Worked great b/c if he started to tilt backward the pillow wouldn't move away from him but stayed in place, keeping him from falling back (hope that makes sense!)Also want to mention that they have EXCELLENT customer service and support.  I contacted the company with a small issue I was having and they went above and beyond any expectations I had to help resolve the issue quickly.  Love companies like this who care about their products and customers!",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green",Fantastic product! This is my 3rd child and the MBF Deluxe is the best nursing pillow I've had. My little one is 7 months now and she is still comfortable using it. When she was first born I would tighten the strap and buckle it but now I just wrap it around for easy use (I read some think it's too time consuming to get on - just don't buckle). The attached pocket is great for holding items like nail clippers so you can trim nails while nursing. I also read some have had trouble with shrinkage after washing - I've not had that problem(do not put in dryer per instructions) At 6 months I used it to help support her sitting on the floor and she would also use it for a little tummy time. She also likes playing with the buckles.,5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green","We recently had a baby boy and my wife bought a Boppy nursing pillow in anticipation of feeding him. She used the product for almost a month, but found it to be somewhat difficult. For example, it didn't fasten to her and moved around as the baby squirmed. Also, it was too soft and tended to sag across her lap. She was always stuffing small blankets under it to get a better more-even upper surface. In discussing the problems with a friend of hers, the friend reported that the My Brest Friend nursing pillow worked much better. Well, we ended up buying a second expensive nursing pillow and it, indeed, works much better. It's just one of the many things we've learned with our first child.The My Brest Friend pillow straps securely and comfortably around the back and fastens firmly with an adjustable sturdy velcro strap. My wife reports that it is comfortable to wear for extended periods of time and, in contrast to the Boppy, doesn't need constant readjustment. Furthermore, the pillow is somewhat stiff and doesn't sag across the lap even though our baby weighs almost 12 pounds. It's hard to judge, but the baby seems more comfortable resting on it too. The pillow has a convenient little pocket with a small velcro fastener. It can be used for a bib, and extra bottle, or use your imagination. It's a nicely designed piece of equipment. Our pillow is exactly the same as this illustrated product, except that it is light blue. Well, who cares about the color? Either one would be OK with us and other covers are available. All in all, when it comes to choosing a nursing pillow, the My Brest Friend is superior.Gary Peterson",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green",great!!!,5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green","Anyone who's spent any time nursing a baby knows that proper position is half the battle. With my first son, I bought the boppy (hadn't even heard of the brest friend). The boppy was a nightmare that resulted in tense shoulders and aching neck (me) and frustration in my son. This time around with my second baby I knew I needed to invest in a good supportive nursing pillow. The brest friend is amazing! I take it with me everywhere I go, and I truly feel it has made breastfeeding sooooooo much easier than it was with my firstborn. I now recommend this pillow to every mom and soon to be mom who plans to nurse.",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green","Purchased this for a friend because I was SO happy with mine.  Sure, you can use a pillow(s) to help support your little one while nursing, but this provides the perfect amount of support and needed stability leading to less issues with sensitivity and chaffing.  The pocket is also a nice feature.  I always keep a burp cloth, chap stick and salve in mine.  It's so great have these items handy.  In the first few months I even kept granola bars to stave off hunger during middle of the night feedings.  The brest friend is also relatively easy to clean.  Just unzip, remove the cover, wash and place back on.  Getting the cover back on can be a bit tricky but it is doable.",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green","I love this nursing pillow. My DS had a hard time latching properly and I had to reposition him often. We used MBF pillow for about 6 months when he seemed to outgrow the need to be lifted so high and liked a bit more wiggle room. I used the football hold and cradle hold and as DS grew, I did have to twist the pillow sideways to support the football hold. Now at 11 months, I just use a regular bed pillow. My neighbor is borrowing the MBF with her twins and says it is an absolute must, especially for her tiniest baby. I also love the little cloth bag. I kept a a tube of lanolin in mine.",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green","It worked very well at the beginning because it was high and firmer enough for my 4 months old. After 2-3 weeks, the material - foam - started to soften and collapse! it became too low. It means I need to buy a new one again?!After all, considering its price, I would not recommend.  Don't waste your money!",2
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green","We tried using the Boppy pillow and found that our kid sunk into the pillow too much and then would sometimes get wedged between the pillow and my wife's body. Our friends recommended the My Brest Friend and for us it works much better. It allows our child to comfortably rest next to my wife's breast. It is also very comfortable for my wife, the only modification that she makes is that she puts a pillow between the pillow to get a little more height. Overall I would highly recommend for anyone breastfeeding!",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green","Thank goodness our doula recommended MBF...she saw that Boppy was clearly not going to work, and my wife and I had no idea that the MBF even existed. It's a lifesaver.",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green","I bought this at a local store for $60 and feel it's been worth every penny and then some. I struggled with breast feeding, especially the first week,  and a big part of that struggle was finding the best way to prop up baby and get comfortable.  Piling up pillows and hunching over baby was not comfortable and was a major hindrance.  This pillow addressed all those problems and kept me very supported and comfy. I've used it faithfully for over 5 weeks.  Slipcover come off easy to clean. The cons are that the baby can basically only feed in a cross cradle type of position,  pillow can't be moved around really to do a football hold.  It could be a bit easier to put on,  as sometimes one-handed it can be challenging.  At any rate,  if you're having challenges with feeding,  don't hesitate to get this - makes so many things SO much easier.",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green",Love this pillow. The back support given is great. I used a boppy for nursing my now 4 yr old and had terrible muscle strain between my shoulder blades. I have had no issues with my back while feeding my 9 lb newborn.,5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green","I'm using this pillow to nurse my 2-month-old right now.  I love this pillow.  It provides great back support, and is comfortable for both mom and baby.  I never get sore arms, back, neck or anything else while using this pillow, no matter how long my little one nurses for.  Note: it only works for the football hold nursing position when the baby is very small.",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green",I couldn't live without this now. The Boppy was a waste of money because my baby kept falling down in the gap between us. This is solidly shaped so that the baby stays on top. Also helps support baby while walking since it locks around uou. You will be happy,5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green","This pillow is a wonderful concept.. but it just did not work for me.  I have several cons..My daughter had latching problems and for the first 6 weeks would only latch in the ""football"" position.  So, it made this pillow impossible to use for the first six weeks.  After that, she latched on normally and I again tried to use this pillow, but found that it put baby up to high for me.  Maybe it was because I was used to just a traditional pillow, but I did not like this pillow.I nursed my daughter for 17 months.. and in my opinion.. save your money - a regular pillow works just as well if not better.  Like I mentioned, wonderful concept, but I was one of the women who these pillows did not work for.. so something to consider before purchasing this pillow!",3
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green","I originally started off with the boppy which was just not working for me. I asked around to some moms and then later bought this once my baby was around 2 mos old. It made breast feeding so much easier. I really wish I would have had this from the start. It definitely brings the baby up higher with it's adjustable strap, and it really saved my back and shoulders which were getting sore from hunching over with the boppy. I also like the convenience of being able to walk around with this and keep things stashed in the little pocket. Next time, I will know to use this from the start! I have also recommended it to all of my first time mom friends.",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green","I am so glad I found out about My Brest Friend via navigating through Amazon.com.  I got the Boppy first, and it is too soft to support my baby for nursing; it also constantly slips away from me, and my baby tends to slip between me and the Boppy. For these reasons, my back felt strained when I used the Boppy for nursing. Then, I bought ""My Brest Friend"" and it worked great -- all the problems that I just mentioned were solved -- it's firm and supportive, and it also ""locks"" around my waist so it won't slip.  It wasn't perfect though; I still needed to use a small pillow or stuff a blanket between the MBF and my arm when my baby was less than 1 month old, but it was alot better than the Boppy.  Now that my baby is more than 2 months old, I don't really need to use this pillow anymore for nursing, but i still use it to support his weight when I carry him around the house since he is quite heavy for my arm and back.  The Boppy is NOT the ideal pillow for nursing, but it is good for letting my baby lie on to rest/sleep and as a support pillow for burping my baby in a sitting position, so I still recommend having a Boppy.",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green",This is a lifesaver especially if you have had a cesarean.  Great backsupport and its great for baby to rest on while you breastfeed.,5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green",I bought this for a gift for my friend. She had a c-section and found this very difficult to use. And by the time she was feeling good enough to use it she didn't because she stuck with the Boppy.,2
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green","I love this breast feeding pillow.  My 4 month old daughter always seems to nurse better when she is on this, than if I am just holding her.  The pocket is great for storing a smartphone (which is wonderful during night feedings).  The best feature is the back support and that it stays on you when you stand up.  Granted it took a while, but I can now multi-task while breastfeeding with this on, without disturbing my daughter.  I absolutely recommend this to all breast feeding moms out there.  Also, I think my daughter really likes the firmness of the pillow.",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green","I don't know why some people use the boppy as a breastfeeding pillow when it constantly slips away from your body and sometimes the baby falls down the hole in the middle.This is great - stays put, very comfortable on your back, and easily adjustable to fit mom and dad.",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green","The biggest difference between the regular My Brestfriend pillow and the deluxe are the strap and the material. I found the material on the original My Brestfriend to be thin and not too soft, the material on the deluxe is soft and thick.The strap on the regular My Brestfriend comes loose over time, the large Velcro strap on the deluxe stays in place so you don't have to readjust.If you have the money I suggest going for the deluxe instead of the original, if you don't have the money, the original My Brestfriend is still amazing and worth every penny!",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green","This is a wonderful product that makes breast feeding about 1000 times easier. Just get it and you wont be sorry, plus it sells for a great price.",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green",The good part of this product is that it is exactly as described and easy to clean. It helped my wife alot. The bad is that you have to strap it on (takes a little getting used to) and then sit in a chair that will accomodate it and nothing with handles that are meant for a normal person.The bad is just a personal preference item which resulted in it not being used much.,4
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green","I have been breastfeeding my newborn by propping up pillows each time. He was just never comfortable enough to fully feed, he kept slipping off and I had to keep adding a blanket rolled under his head an an extra pillow here and there. It got overwhelming and as a first time mom I was super frustrated. I've only had this pillow one day and wow what a difference it made! It is so much more comfortable for me and the baby. He feeds for longer periods and is more fulfilled after each feeding. He is much more pleasant now where as before he was always crying because I had to keep shifting him. I was ready to give up breastfeeding but decided to try this pillow as a last resort. It was recommended by the lactation consultant and boy am I thankful. I would highly recommend this for the sake of your baby as well as your sanity!",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green","Love this product! I love that my baby doesn't fall in the crack between my stomach and the pillow. I tried the Mombo for a month until I finally purchased this, and I'm very happy I did!",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green","I used this at every feeding for my daughters first 5 weeks.  Now that we have the breastfeeding down, I rarely use it' with that said, I guess I could have lived without it (why I gave only 4 stars).  So if you want to save $40, use a bed pillow.  Although, it is great when my younger nieces want to hold the baby, gives good support for the little one.  I would get this pillow over the boppie (sp?), this one has back support and if you need to get up to get something, it stays on and you don't have to reposition yourself.  I will use it for the next baby!",4
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green","My DS is now almost 6 months old and I can tell you, I could not live without this thing the first 4 months of his life!! I took it everywhere - to my parents', my in-laws, I even took it to friends' homes if I was visiting. It puts the baby in the perfect position and is very comfortable to wear. It is adjustable, so from the moment I brought DS home to 4 months later when my body had gotten progressively smaller, the fit was never a problem.It has a small pouch pocket in the front, in which I kept a small tube of nipple cream and a small washcloth for dribbles. Once DS got bigger, he started to outgrow it (weight-wise), but even now I still use it for night feedings. He falls asleep on and if I didn't move around so much, he would sleep there all night long!The cover is removable and can be washed, which it does fine, as long as you make sure the velcro doesn't get caught on any other laundry and tear stitching or something else. I suggest washing it on its own.It is a bit more cumbersome than the Boppy since you really need to clasp it together for it to stay in position. When you have a hungry baby, sometimes that short amount of time to do the clasp can seem like an eternity! But that is a small inconvenience. I actually have one of each - the Boppy for one room and the MBF for the nursery.I highly recommend this anyway. I love it!!",5
"My Brest Friend Deluxe Pillow, Light Green","This is good for mom who sticks to breastfeeding for longer time. This may be the best breastfeeding pillow I could ever find at Amazon. It can handle the  baby well and give your back adequate support. My baby is 3 months, the only problem is she is already longer than the pillow. But this is not an issue, since you can position your baby as you like. It can hold her very well.",5
Fisher-Price Play n Cuddle Gym,"My daughter is only two months old, so she isn't quite old enough to really play with these things.  She can reach out and grab or smack the toys, and when she is in a good mood will laugh at them, but it doesn't entertain her for long.  I LOVE that they are plush and can be taken apart to use as stuffed toys as well.  The toys don't make noise and are very simple, but the price was outstanding.  I paid only 15 dollars on Amazon for this gym, while most others were upwards of 40 dollars!",3
Tiny Love ActiviTot - Sun Garden,"It's nice baby gym, but we used it only till 7 mos. Great present for baby shower.",4
Tiny Love ActiviTot - Sun Garden,"The Sun Garden activity mat is very cute with lots of great colors, fun crinkles and things to look at and reach for.  The verticle toys are particularly appealing to my 3.5 mo old daughter.",5
Peanut Burp Cloth &amp; Bib Gift Set,it's very nice cotton and i love the packaging.  but the print quality is not so great.  it seems like iron-on print...it's a cute small gift for anyone who's having a baby.,3
Peanut Burp Cloth &amp; Bib Gift Set,"It's cute and it comes in a box, that you can use to mail it. Though really it's just a bib and burp cloth (btw - it's a little bigger than I thought)",5
2 Red Hens Whole Roost Bag W/ Changing Pad-Cherry Tomato,I was amazed when I saw how cheap this bag was compared to the others and even the same one from the 2 Red Hens site.  It shipped super-quick and I love it!!,5
2 Red Hens Whole Roost Bag with Changing Pad - Goody Gumdrop,"This diaper bag looked adorable on Amazon, but when I received it I was pretty disappointed.  The straps looked as though they were brown in the picture, but they turned out to be a faded black denim material.  This changed the whole look of the bag for me, and I returned it.  It was still a very cute bag, just not the style I was hoping for.",3
2 Red Hens Whole Roost Bag W/ Changing Pad-Serendipity,"If I could rate the aesthetics of this bag and the quality separately, I would give the cuteness 5 stars and the durability 2 stars.  I have had this bag for about six months.  I use it pretty much everyday.  It is a big bag and could hold a lot, but if you fill it up or put anything too heavy in it (probably the heaviest thing I've toted is a hard back novel, in addition to regular baby necessities), the straps will detach from the bag.  I have already had to re-sew the straps on twice and the bag is due again for some more mending.  I have two children and while this bag is big enough to hold everything that two children would need for say, church or a trip to grandma's, the straps are not sewn on securely enough to support all it can hold.  Also, the large floral print fabric is covered with a layer of clear vinyl, which is nice as it protects the fabric and makes it easy to clean.  However, after less than six months of use, parts of the vinyl started to tear, like the corners on the bottom and where the straps started coming loose.  I was disappointed that the bag didn't last longer, especially for the price.BUT, the fabric is so adorable-- maybe that's what you're really paying for--, the button closure is twee and there is even a matching red button closure on the fantastic changing pad.  I get compliments on this bag ALL the time.  It is different and cute and I do get a warm fuzzy feeling when I look at it!  I think I am going to contact the company about the problems I've had with the vinyl tearing and see what they say.",3
Skip Hop Saddle Bag-Charcoal,"I have this saddle bag hanging off the back of my Maclaren and I love it. It is the perfect size for a wallet, a couple of diapers, wipes and snacks. I got it at a great price here, $10!!I love Amazon!",4
Skip Hop Saddle Bag-Charcoal,"I love the Chicco Liteway but we know with all umbrella strollers, there is limited basket space.  This fits my needs perfect for the day at the zoo or any other trip that will last about half a day.  The bag is small as other post have said but it fit a lot!I have the following in my bag:Front zipper pocket: Child size spoon and fork, 4 wet ones singles, kleenex, neosporan spray, and a small first first aid kitInside pocket: Two size 5 diapers, ziplock bag of wipes, arm and hammer diaper baggy, disposable changing pad, a pack of table toppers, neutrogena sunblock for body and the face sunblock, ace instant compress, a light weight wind jacket, and a change of clothes.I can now put this on the outside and put just our lunch box in the basket.  I'm IN LOVE!",5
Skip Hop Saddle Bag-Charcoal,"i love this bag, i got it because my friend had one, her had a strap. but i guess they don't come with it anymore so i added one it was really easy, now we use it as a all the time diaper bag, it hold so much: one shirt,pants or shorts, 2-3 toy cars, 3-4 diapers, some wipes, a small things of baby powder, snakes,Kleenex and that's just the inside, in the front pouch, it holds Disposable place mats, spoon and fork, bib. it can even hold more if i wanted to put more in, its great. we love it, even my husband uses it!",4
Skip Hop Saddle Bag-Charcoal,"This bag is terrific.  It's very roomy and fits diapers/wipes/potty seat covers/placemats/hadwipes and more!  I bought it for vacation and it held everything I needed and left my hands free!  But when I wanted to take everything with me say into a restaurant, it pulls right off and has a handle for carrying.  I am very happy with this purchase.",4
Skip Hop Saddle Bag-Charcoal,"I really like these diaper bags. We originally bought it so my husband could carry around a diaper bag and not have it look like a ""typical"" diaper bag. I ended up taking it over. They are very durable and I take it EVERY WHERE!!I really love the Camo print. I have a different style, but would buy the Saddle Bag in a heart beat. The bag has different compartments so you are able to keep many things seperated. I am also able to find things in a jiffy.I recommend these products to every mommy or daddy!",5
2 Red Hens Celebration Collection Bib Set-Ornaments And Swirls,I bought these for a friend with twin boys and I am really disappointed.  I think they are on sale because the neck hole is not adjustable and is very small.  It would only fit a baby with a tiny neck.  Very disappointed.,1
Skip Hop Pronto-Bubblegum,"I received a blue one as a baby shower gift and it was one of the presents that we used the most with our first born son. It went everywhere with us and since then I have given it out as shower gifts on many occasions. Funny, now that we have a 2nd baby we just don't use it very often anymore. I suppose because with 2 you have lots more stuff to pack for outings.It's very thoughtfully designed with a handle and a clip, so you can clip it to your stroller. My husband spilled coffee on our and I was bummed at how stained it was. It has a couple of pockets to fit things like wipes (comes with a good wipe case), extra diapers, ointment, etc. Then someone told me that it could go in the wash, so I gave that a try and was delighted that the old coffee stain came out. Over a very long period of usage, the corners where the clear plastic are folded have little pin holes, but that really hasn't affected the performance. I recommend this product.",5
Skip Hop Toolbox - Sky Blue/Lime,"I was looking for a caddy to keep in our master bedroom while our newborn is in with us so we didn't have to go change diapers in his room.  Since I generally like Skip Hop products I thought this would be a good item.  As soon as I opened it though I hated it.  The caddy is made of hard plastic and is incredibly loud and heavy even when empty.  The smallest movement makes everything rattle.  The side pockets just slide on and move easily so it makes the whole thing just feel incredibly cheap and flimsy.  The same for the drawers - just plastic sliding in plastic so it feels cheap.  Despite how cheap it all feels, the cost (almost $40 at the time) is rediculous.  I am returning and am getting a canvas one from JJ Cole.",1
Skip Hop Toolbox - Sky Blue/Lime,"I just bought this for my baby who is due in April. This will be my second child and thought it was time to upgrade from the little plastic pink basket I used to hold all my 1st daughter's lotions, q-tips, nail cutters, saline drops, etc. I'm testing it with my 2 years old's stuff to see how it works and I love it so far! First off, the toolbox is very pretty (I have the one in in sky blue/lime) and well made.  The plastic is thick and durable and can be wiped down easily.  I don't use the middle portion for diapers though since they are stashed in a large container that the toolbox rests on top of. I wouldn't suggest using the middle portion for diapers because the two side pockets wouldn't hold enough on their own. I use the middle portion of the toolbox to whole lotions, brushes, leave-in conditioner, saline drops, etc.  The two side pockets are used to hold nail cutters, toothbrushes, toothpaste, nasal bulbs and diaper lotions. The drawers on one side hold cotton balls and qtips while the other side houses binkies and hair accessories. I really do love the toolbox but I took off one star because the drawers tend to fly all the way out of one side very easily. Then when you go to push it back, you've got to lift them up a little to slide back thru the other side. They should have made the drawers four separate ones instead of two. Other than the drawer thing it's easy to assemble and is a great organizational item in my daughter's room. Will probably invest in another one for the new baby on the way since this test run looks more like a permanent station!",4
Skip Hop Duo - Glam-Olive/Khaki,The bag is very thin.  It doesn't stand on its own.  I expected a bad that I could you for my two children under 2.  This didn't allow me to easily pack the bag or find items already inside.  I am returning the bag shortly.  Also the color was not exactly what I expected.,2
"Skip Hop Splash Bottle Dryer, Translucent","The color is so beautiful,I like white and red.i think my baby must like it. I will sent my friends.",5
"Skip Hop Splash Bottle Dryer, Translucent","My husband is in charge of washing the bottles every night and has been quite happy with this drying rack.  We both appreciate its compact and modern design.  Our baby is using wide-neck Dr. Browns bottles now and I was concerned that they would not be compatible with this product.  However, the bottles fit just fine on the big prongs and the lower racks provide good drying spots for all of the other parts like the valves, nipples, etc.  I imagine the same would be true for Born Free bottles.  We have the clear colored rack and have not had any of the problems with mold or mildew that other reviewers mentioned.  I think you just have to tip it into the sink from time to time to drain any residual water that may have collected; hardly a big deal!",5
"Skip Hop Splash Bottle Dryer, Translucent",Works great. Helps me keep all bottles and pumping supplies organized. Love the brush storage in the middle. A must have for baby.,4
"Skip Hop Splash Bottle Dryer, Translucent","Can hold lost of bottle parts, brush is practical although it's a bit too soft.  Sits pretty on the counter with all kinds of kitchen decor (neutral colors), so if you prefer, you don't need to store it each time.  Dry easily.",4
"Skip Hop Splash Bottle Dryer, Translucent","After three weeks my brush broke too!  Cannot find a replacement, I do not want to buy a whole new rack.  Design fault that they should correct.  Not good enough",2
"Skip Hop Splash Bottle Dryer, Translucent",,5
"Skip Hop Splash Bottle Dryer, Translucent",I have loved having this drying rack for baby bottles and nipples.  I don't have to have a soggy dishcloth on my counter anymore and it's really kind of cute.,5
"Skip Hop Splash Bottle Dryer, Translucent","I've been using this drying rack for 3 weeks, and I love how functional it is.  First off, it's a perfect size.  Big enough to hold a number of Born Free bottles (and all their parts), but it doesn't take up a ton of counter space.  I also really like that each of the 3 sections rotate separately, and can easily fit bottles as well as small pump parts.",5
"Skip Hop Splash Bottle Dryer, Translucent","We ordered a second one of these for the countertop in the kitchen. It takes up the less space (less than the ""grass""), and is mold free. Good design. We liked having two on the counter, but you can manage with one if you have one infant.",5
"Skip Hop Splash Bottle Dryer, Translucent","Fantastice product.  Easy drying for clean bottles, bottle accessories, and sippy cups and easy access for further daily use.  Easy to take apart and clean.  Everying that has been washed is not all over the place.  I would recommend for others to use.  I will buy this as a gift for new parents.",5
"Skip Hop Splash Bottle Dryer, Translucent",It is better for slimmer bottles other than that great design and color. I dont use the brush that comes along because i dont think it will do the scrubing and cleansing as well as the brushes with a sponge head,4
"Skip Hop Splash Bottle Dryer, Translucent","i found this item by searching amazon for ""made in usa"", however when i received it, i looked on the box and it is clearly labeled made in china.  not for me.",2
"Skip Hop Splash Bottle Dryer, Translucent",I bought this drying rack because it went with the red and modern themed kitchen I have.  I have had it for almost 2 years now and love it.  I use it with the Dr. Brown bottles and it holds them and the parts nicely.  I like how easily it comes apart so I can throw it in the dishwasher.  I would recommend washing it atleast once every 2 weeks because it can get yucky in the bottom where water sits.,5
"Skip Hop Splash Bottle Dryer, Translucent",This is a great space saver.  I am able to let all my bottle pieces dry.  I love that it spins so nicely and I am able to leave all the parts on the rack.  I don't understand all the negative comments because we find it to be amazing!,5
"Skip Hop Splash Bottle Dryer, Translucent","This is a really great bottle and breast pump parts dryer.  I have nothing bad to say about it.  I know others have had issues with water collecting on the bottom, I have not.  Great item.",5
"Thermos Ice Mat, 6 Cube",They puncture pretty early upon using them.,2
"Thermos Ice Mat, 6 Cube",I have used these about 12 times now and still seems to be holding up great! I use two of them in my sons lunch box and he says his lunch is nice and cold 5 hours later after packed.. Definitely would recommend these!,5
"Thermos Ice Mat, 6 Cube","compact, light weight, great quality - they fit in any lunch box, after frozen you can still bend the package. I've had them for over 1 month and no damage yet.  fast shipping!",5
"Thermos Ice Mat, 6 Cube","Love it. Works exactly the way they should stay cold for hours. Fast shipping, Would recommend for anybody looking for cooler accessories..",5
"Thermos Ice Mat, 6 Cube",Smaller than I thought they'd be they're still functional.  And I suppose from a &#34;re-freezing&#34; point of view having them smaller doesn't take as long.,4
"Thermos Ice Mat, 6 Cube","I bought this to use in my lunch bag and they work great.  They are flat, so they don't take up much room either in the freezer or the lunch bag.  They were still cold after an eight-hour day.",4
"Thermos Ice Mat, 6 Cube",It's what it says it is.  That's all it needs to be.  I left mine in the zip lock bag it comes in for extra protection.,3
"Thermos Ice Mat, 6 Cube","We have two of these, have had for 3 years or so.  One has lost one water pocket, and the other has lost three... so, not the best.  However, they both still work for keeping lunch cold for 5 and 3 hours respectively.  I say good value because they are pretty cheap and we have gotten years of wear from them.  I would buy them again.",4
"Thermos Ice Mat, 6 Cube","Crap if you cut it wrong, I cut it frozen and later found out I cut it wrong to find it leak in my lunch bag.  So if you cut it, make sure you do it right.  Not bad prior.",2
"Thermos Ice Mat, 6 Cube","A well-made ice pack. Seems to be sealed well, and though I haven't owned them long I am hoping they will last longer than most freezer packs without leaking or breaking (which tends to happen with cheaply made packs.) The design is great for most lunch boxes, but the 6 cube pack is fairly small, so you will want a few of them at least, or perhaps some of the larger versions as well. (I initially ordered 1 6-cube, and 1 9-cube for a lunch box scenario and found myself severely lacking in cooling power and needing to pick up a couple more.)I would currently recommend this product to anyone needing some ice packs, and I will update this review if anything changes.",5
"Thermos Ice Mat, 6 Cube","Works Great and fits the bag great!!  I thought this was a gel bag, but I was wrong.  I do like it!!",4

Buddy Bears Dark Brown 16&quot; by Kids Preferred,This bear was given to our daughter as a gift when she was born...she has no allergies but he is a great quality bear and has taken all the abuse a really great and well loved teddy bear should take.  We like the ability to clean him and it's amazing how well the bear survives the wash.  We have two so we can interchange them.  Our daughter absolutely loves her ""Al"" bear and so does everyone who meets him!  Really great product especially at such a low price!,5
Buddy Bears Dark Brown 16&quot; by Kids Preferred,"Buddy Bear is huggable and very soft.  My grandson was just born on Sat. 9/5/11 so he won't be playing with the bear for awhile.  It is very cute and I know he will love it.  It seems well made and if it is anything like the one I got my granddaughter 4 1/2 years ago it will last a long, long time.  She still loves ""Pops"" and plays with him all the time.  I recommend this to anyone looking for a cute bear to give to a child.",5
Buddy Bears Dark Brown 16&quot; by Kids Preferred,Buddy Bear is the perfect size for cuddling.  He arrived quickly and has been a big hit. I really like that it can be washed over and over again to keep it clean & healthy.  Thank you!,5
Kids Preferred Amazing Baby Blanket Teether Bear,Love this but I would have preferred the middle part to be soft rather than the plastic feel. But I love it anyhow,4
Kids Preferred Amazing Baby Blanket Teether Bear,It is really cute and well made but it did not catch my babys attention!,3
Kids Preferred Amazing Baby Blanket Teether Bear,"Our baby does love this toy and seems to re-discover one of the hands or legs every couple of days.  It makes for a great toy to hand him as he rarely seems bored by it.  Only CON is that it needs to be hand washed to clean it, which makes for a little bit of a hassle.",4
Kids Preferred Amazing Baby Blanket Teether Bear,"my wife bought this for my baby boy, he absolutely loves it. there's some material inside the body that crinkle and crackle when he plays with it. the hands are awesome for biting/teething. the feet dangle some loops and make squirt sounds when he squeezes them. he enjoys it in the car ride to daycare. easily one of his favorite toy (he's 9months now).",5
Kids Preferred Amazing Baby Blanket Teether Bear,"I cannot for the life of me figure out why companies manufacture anything made of cloth that cannot be immersed in water for cleaning purposes for children.  As cute as this teether is and as much as my daughter likes it, what good is it if it cannot be properly washed?  The directions on the product say to ""surface wipe"".  That is dumb.I like this but would have preferred that the company manufacture something that could be immersed in water and properly cleaned.Annoyed...",3
Kids Preferred Amazing Baby Blanket Teether Bear,"My friend was given one of these bears, and her baby loved it. I found it on amazon, and bought for my baby.  Now my baby loves it too. I highly recommend this toy.",5
Kids Preferred Amazing Baby Blanket Teether Bear,"I ordered this for my son (2 months old) when I noticed that he paid more attention to toys that crinkled than ones that rattled.  Initially, he couldn't pick it up but would bat at it when I left it on his belly.  He seemed perplexed at the noise it made when he moved his arms.  Now (3 months) he grabs it and crinkles it.  He is not quite using it for teething yet but is starting to put the ears in his mouth.  This is the one toy that goes with him everywhere.  I am so pleased with his reaction to this that I ordered the one that looks like a rabbit for my niece.  She's actually not born yet but I'm sure she'll love it too.",5
Kids Preferred Amazing Baby Blanket Teether Bear,"This was my daughter's favorite toy for months and months. It's perfect because it's nice and small, easy to pack and super entertaining for kids under a year. My only complaint is I wish that I could throw it into the washing machine to get it clean. Other than that it's the perfect toy! I've also gotten some of the other kids preferred blanket teethers that were great as well. My favorite for a boy is the alligator--it's adorable!!!",5
Kids Preferred Amazing Baby Blanket Teether Bear,I purchased this as a shower gift.  It will be nice for when the baby is bigger and teething.  It crinkles and is soft at the same time.,4
Kids Preferred Amazing Baby Blanket Teether Bear,We got this teether as a gift and my son loves the crinkle noise of the bear and chewing on the rings. It is a multi-sensory toy. We ordered one to give as a shower gift. This toy keeps my baby entertained for awhile.,5
Kids Preferred Amazing Baby Blanket Teether Bear,"I like the bear, it's about 12"" high, crinkles, squeeks, has pockets you can put small things in, like fingers. The hands are rubber, the face is flat with foam, it's colorful and well baby sized. However it's handwash only and you can't put it in the dryer. I don't know if the baby will like it as it's not born yet, but I'm sure she will. It is cute, and pretty portable.",4
Kids Preferred Amazing Baby Blanket Teether Bear,i thougth i would give my niece something good the colors are pale and the finishing is poorly madebig disappointment,1
Kids Preferred Amazing Baby Blanket Teether Bear,Bought this for my granddaughter.  She really likes it.  It makes a crinkly sound that gets her attention and then she likes to teeth on the other parts.,5
Kids Preferred Amazing Baby Blanket Teether Bear,"The bear is actually not very cute to me but my 6 month old loves this so I do too! I think she loves it so much because it's the easiest thing for her hands to manipulate. She can easily grab onto the rings or grab onto the blanket part of the bear's body and pass it from one hand to the other. Even though she's teething, she doesn't like the teethers as much as the rings. It is a very LOUD toy as another reviewer said because the body of this bear blanket makes that crinkly sound that babies love so much. A great toy for home, in the car or on the go!",5
Kids Preferred Amazing Baby Soft Book,Our 6 month old granddaughter LOVES this book. She finds the bold graphics fascinating and loves looking at herself in the mirror. The star and circle shapes are easy to grip and constantly in her mouth.,5
Kids Preferred Amazing Baby Sound Balls,"My niece loved it--she is just over one year and is fascinated with all types of balls.  The are cute, big enough to not roll under furniture and all make a unique (but quiet) sound.",5
Kids Preferred Amazing Baby Sound Balls,"When we first purchased the ball set, our infant didn't show much interest.  But around 5 months, when he could reach out and grasp onto objects, they became one of his favorite toys.  The different noises, bright colors, and great designs keep him coming back!  Additionally, their size and carrying case makes them a great toy to travel with.",5

Kids Preferred Amazing Baby Developmental Light-Up Musical Mirror,"My two month old son loves this mirror...He is amazed with the lights and his reflection. This plays music, has moving lights and a good sized mirror that can attach to a crib or folds to stand! Well worth the money.",5
Kids Preferred Amazing Baby Developmental Light-Up Musical Mirror,Was happy to find something suitable and age appropriate for my 3 1/2 month old grandson.  It is difficult to find items that a 3 month old can notice...yet is something that will grow with him for quite some time.  I couldn't be happier with this item.,5
Kids Preferred Amazing Baby Developmental Light-Up Musical Mirror,"My baby really likes this mirror.  It stands up better on its own than another similar mirror I purchased.  Because of the thick backing, it takes up a lot of space in my diaper bag, which may be an issue for some.  The lights and music are nice, too, but the music only plays for a few seconds.",4
Kids Preferred Amazing Baby Developmental Light-Up Musical Mirror,"I had bought this a long time ago and it was the best item I have purchased for my daughter. She looks at her self, smiles and the colors patterns are great.Also, another great feature it hangs and plays music. keeps her busy, she can't seems to put it down.:)",4
Kids Preferred Amazing Baby Developmental Light-Up Musical Mirror,I bought this for my 5 month old daughter for Christmas and she loves it. She likes looking at herself and others in the mirror and the music and lights are fun too. She also tolerates tummy time longer when she is using this toy. The only thing I would change about it is I wish the items around the mirror were removable. She likes to chew on the butterfly but it is difficult for her to manipulate due to it being attached. I would recomend this to other mothers.,4
Kids Preferred Amazing Baby Developmental Light-Up Musical Mirror,"My son liked it and although he is now almost 2, if asked, he would recommend you purchase it for your child.",5
"Mimi the Sardine Child's Apron, Bugs",It's easy to fit appropriately around a young child's neck and washes easily with a sponge.  Great for boys toddler and older.  Love it!,5
"Mimi the Sardine Child's Apron, Bugs","My son can splash around the water table all he wants now and I don't have to worry about constant clothes changes. It protects against water without being too ""plastic-y"". It's cute, too and totally adjustable. Highly recommend, though wish it was cheaper so I could buy some for his friends, too!",5
Leachco The Natural - Contoured Nursing Pillow - Pink Pin Dot,"I have used Bobbies and others. Now for my third child I have found this one and love it.This fits well around you without leaving gaps. Your baby will snuggle close to you and you can adjust it when baby gets older so that you can elevate the baby, give a bit more head up or however she prefers to nurse.The pillow snuggles right in and around you. PERFECT for rocking chairs.But also to just for lap use, like on a couch or such. I have one for upstairs and one for downstairs.It moves right in as the pictures shows. The baby is NOT laying off the pillow, as shown in the pictures, unless you want her to.I love that it doesn't show stains. I have a pink one and the color is beautiful. Soft but not pastel. It never loses shape. Bounces right back or stays soft but in shape.As you can tell I am really happy and satisfied with it. Can recommend it.Note: it has no changing option. It is one peace and you can't take the cover off.LOVE the prodcut. Never felt that satisfied or happy with any of the other nursing pillows.Especially the Bobby pillow. It never fit right nor around me.Usually things are made for shorter women, but I am 6 feet it works well for me.My friends who are shorter have come over and used it for their baby and it works well for them also.Doesn't lose shape or firmness.It is soft to touch but feels like a very good pillow you would rest your head on.Enjoy it.",5
Leachco The Natural - Contoured Nursing Pillow - Pink Pin Dot,"I hate this nursing pillow.  When I put my baby on my lap, on the pillow, the pillow wanted to slip forward constantly.  The baby kept falling between me and the pillow.  I am a small person and it doesn't stay in place.  I would have liked the Boppy pillow better, since it goes around your belly.  I wish I hadn't gotten this pillow and can't return it as I got it before the baby came.  Now I have to donate it, hope the next person finds it useful.  Waste of money.",1
"BPA FREE 6-Pack 8oz Printed Bottles with Organizer (Medium Flow Silicone Nipples), Blue","This bottles have very cute designs, but it can get easilly scratch like paint for some reason. First time i used them i boiled them in hot water to sterilized, and when I pulled them out with a tong the design got scratched. And I was pretty careful, i didnt even use force.. So it doesnt takes much for it to scratch.. But then again the design is outside anyway so it didnt really bugged me, as long as my baby cant get to that paint residue its ok i guess.. So all in all bottles are good. They look good and tall, good size for me :)",4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"Every child has that one toy they cannot leave home without- this is it for our daughter.  Mortimer Moose is by far her favorite toy.  There are so many colors and textures and places to grab onto, she never gets bored.  I bought it for her when she was 4 months old, and she is 8 months now and still loves it.  I'd absolutely recommend it for any young baby!Another note- Mortimer's washing instructions say ""surface wash only"" but I've put him in the washing machine many times with no problem, then hang to dry.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,Mortimer the Moose is so adorable!  I can't wait for my little to come in December!  Definitely worth the money+ some!,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"This is a great toy! My daughter is 6 months old and this has been one of her favorite toys since she was 2 months old. It has lots of texture, crinkles, squeaks and can be hung from a stroller or other baby apparatus. Definitely one of our best baby toys.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"I purchased this after my 4 month old daughter loved playing with the one at my sister's house.  It has been great.  It keeps her attention with all the different parts.  She'll chew on the antlers, the feet, the tail, etc.  This is our go-to toy when we leave the house.  He hooks easily onto our playmat or our stroller.  A good investment!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"This is one of baby's fave toys - teether ears to chew, squeaker to squeak, rings to pull. And he's learning the sign language for ""moose"", too :).",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"We received this as a gift for our new baby. Now at 3 months, it's her favorite toy. When she was younger she would just stare at it, but in the past few weeks we've really seen her motor skills improve. It started with her just holding on to it, to bringing it up to her mouth and sucking on its face, to now she can shake it while holding on to the white ring or antlers and pass it from hand to hand. We are thinking about getting some of the other similar Lamaze brand toys based on her love for this guy. She just gets so excited when we bring him out.I'm a bit silly, so we decided to rename him to Bruce the Moose and he even has his own song about him liking to drink his juice and be a silly goose. :)",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"My 7mo old baby loves this toy. She has been playing with it for the past couple months every time we give it to her, which is every other day. She rotates on her favorite pieces. First, she used to love banging the plastic rings at the ""tail"". Next, she was fascinated with the plastic horns. Then, she discovered and enjoyed mouthing the hooves. Now, she loves biting the scarf or ears. There are so many different parts to this toy to allow the baby to enjoy. Most likely, your baby will enjoy it too.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"I boughtLamaze Patty the PandaandLamaze Jacques the Peacockin addition toLamaze Mortimer the Moose. My 4-month old is interested in all of her Lamaze toys, but if you are only going to buy one, I definitely recommend the moose. My baby is fascinated by the moose, he has a soft body, rubber antlers and his feet dangle, with brightly colored ends and bells.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"We renamed Mortimer the Moose to Bruce the Moose shortly after buying him, just because we felt the name fitted him better ;)We have a couple of the Lamaze toys and Bruce has been the favorite with our son.  From a young age, he was intrigued by the different colors, shapes and textures, and the clip means it can travel from the play mat to the car to the stroller.He's not a snuggly toy, but Bruce does encourage touch and play from an early age.  As a Dad with little toy knowledge until now, Bruce is a must have.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"This is a wonderful versatile toy.  I bought ""Mortimer"" for my six-month old grandaughter, and it's one of her favorite toys.  She is constantly discovering new ways to play with him, but slapping him around when he dangles over her, with his legs flying in all directions always evokes laughter; his plastic ears are not to be ignored for chewing when she holds him, and so is his ""ring tail.""  This is a toy that brings joy.  What more could you ask for?",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"I did not think a 3 month old could have a favorite toy, but Mortimer has proven me wrong.  My baby loves this moose.  When I first was playing with it in the store she started smiling when I went to put it back she grabbed on to him and bit his nose.His antlers and teethers...but soft enough for her to suck on and enjoy.  His fur is not long enough to be a choking hazard.  Each foot makes a different noise.  His colors are attractive.  The top hook makes it easy to attach him to her gym or diaper bag (so I do not forget him)  His eyes are baby proof along with his tail.  And his squeeky middle is a nice treat when she finds it.  This toy is well worth the money spent.  I will be making Mortimer a regular baby shower gift for my friends too.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,This turned into one of my sons favorite toys.....................it's a good one.  Cute with lots of character.  Not much else to say.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"Great toy for crib or car. Sturdy and well-made. Comes in other animals, but &#34;we&#34; like Mortimer Moose the best.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,My daughter has loved Morty since he arrived! She is 5mos old and is kept entertained by Morty for pretty long chunks of time. His squeak has interupted many a tantrum. The Moose is now in my will!,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"This was my niece's favorite Lamaze toy. Before she had teeth, she would gum the antlers longer than she would pay attention to ANYTHING else. I used the hooves to show and name her different colors (each hoof bottom is a different color). She also liked sucking on Mortimer's nose for some reason. I think it's the ripply, textured fur. Oh, and the two rings on Mortimer's [...], or I guess his ""tails,"" are great differently-patterned/textured sorts of rings.Oh, but don't stick him in the dryer. His fur pills.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"I introduced this toy to my son at 2 months and he loves it. he has just learned to start holding and grabbing things and ""Morty"" gives him plenty of opportunities to do that. He is not teething yet so while the gummy antlers do find their way in his mouth once and a while, he enjoys sucking on the soft nose a little more at this point. When he is done playing with Morty I often find he will snuggle him while falling asleep.The only down side for me is that my dog loves this toy too! I have to keep an extra close eye on it so it doesn't end up on the floor for fear that I may never see it again!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"My son LOVES his little moose toy.  It's really easy for him to grab and manipulate.  Good size, nice colors, overall great baby toy!",5

Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"I bought this for the coming arrival of my baby boy. It's really cute and colorful, but pretty big. I couldn't hang it on my infant carrier without it whacking my kid in the face.",4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"Our nephew loved it and instantly started to suck on the soft plastic antlers.  I thought it was one of the Lamaze toys that had the pull cord on the top and would wiggle up, but that wasn't the case.  He still likes it regardless.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"I love this moose, and more importantly, so does my baby.  I use plastic links to attach it to his carseat, and it keeps him entertained as we drive.  Then I detach it when we get home and he plays with it some more.  He loves to chew on his feet...especially the blue one for some reason...lol",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"It's a great toy, very colorful and  attractive, good materials I definitively  like this toys brand,easy to attach anywhere or to take along",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"It does all the things promised in the description.  Both my kids love it.  It makes noise without being obnoxious.  It's soft, cute, and durable.  Ours has the purple antlers, and looks much better than the yellow antlers in the one shown now.  We liked Mortimer so much we ordered another to give as a gift.  The price was great when we ordered and we could not be more pleased with this toy.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,It was a great purchase keeps him busy for a good 30 mins which is saying something since he's only 5 months lol,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"Both my and my friend's 4-month old girls love their Mortimer Moose toys.  My daughter will play with hers longer than any of her other toys.  I was skeptical - so many of these toys just seem like recipes for overstimulation.  But she loves it and really enjoys checking out all the various textures, shapes, etc.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,I loved this moose.  It was my grandsons favorite toy for his first year and a half.  Very durable and entertaining.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"I bought three of these as gifts for different people I know that just had a baby. This toys seemed so fun! Two of the feet have bells and the other two have a material that makes crunchy noises (the scarf does to). I think the head has a rattle and the body make a squeaky sound when you push it. Besides that, the colors and patterns are cool and the different textures are fun. I have not seen this with a baby, but I imagine that babies will love it. I played with it a bit myself.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,""Mr. Moose"" travels with our son in his car seat.  He absolutely loves this toy.  The feet crinkle and rattle.  Well worth the purchase.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,I attached him to her carseat and now we stand a decent chance of actually taking an outing without her screaming in her seat.  She chews on his nose and falls asleep clutching him tightly.  There are lots of different textures and colors for her to explore.  Great toy.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,Not the case! It's huge! We already had Fifi the Fly which my daughter absolutely LOVES! So we ended up giving this one away as a baby shower gift.,4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"My sister had Mortimer the Moose for her boys, and they loved it so much that it became her go-to gift for parents of newborns. I've started doing the same, buying Mortimer or other toys from this series as gifts for co-workers and friends.  The results are that this toy usually becomes a favorite, great for distracting or cheering a fussy baby!  One friend just reported that her 6 month old daughter gets &#34;so excited&#34; when she sees the toy, that they have to keep it hidden away when not in use.Something about the combination of textures and colors is absolute magic for babies.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"We love all of the Lamaze take-along-toys and we own almost a dozen of them.  That being said, Mortimer is one of our favorites.  When our son was very young he loved to chew on his antlers and the bright colors always got his attention.  We have also purchased Mortimer the Moose for two other family friends- and their babies love him too!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"Mortimer is still our favorite Lamaze toy at 9 months. I think his fuzziness has a lot to do with it. His antlers are good for chewing, and his feet too. The feet crinkle and the belly squeaks so he's got sound covered. Good all around toy for baby. 5 stars!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"Well, we really loved Mortimer until today. Our 4 month old was chewing on the antlers and all of a sudden she started making a weird noise...the antlers are a bit too small and are able to fit totally in her mouth. She got part of it lodged in her throat and started to choke. Luckily, she was fine but it gave us quite a scare. Unfortunately, I will not be recommending this toy to anyone.",1
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"My three month old daughter loves this toy!  We don't leave the house without it!  She loves the colors and different textures, and she's just recently starting chewing on the rings and antlers.  I'd highly recommend this toy for anyone with an infant!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"Has anyone told you when you buy these hanging toys and mobiles, to take in consideration how it might look to a brand new baby - he sees it from bellow! Well this moose is quite big :) And his feet have pattern on them (pretty interesting from below).The legs you can pull on and the horns are good for teething, made of rubber.I like it :)",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"I bought Mort for my son when he was about 2.5 months old. This was the FIRST toy he paid attention to. I bought Jacques the Peacock and he ignored it. When I bought Mort, it was an instant lifesaver. I could finally put my son in his bouncer and he'd be mesmerized by Mort for a good half hour. My son is now 6 months old, and it's still our go-to toy. He is teething, so he loves the rings and the antlers. He will just stare at the colorful hooves for 15 minutes at a time.I can't recommend this toy enough. Mort is the best!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,This is my son's favorite toy. He is 6 months and we take this everywhere. He loves the crinkly feet and to chew on the antlers. A must buy.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"Mr Moose is my daughters favorite toy. I bought it as car seat toy but she loves to play with all the time. We add additional links to it and put it on her play mat and then take the links off again for nap time. Mr. Moose has lots of diiferent features. The legs make a crinkling sound, if you squeeze the body he squeaks and the ears are simply amazing for my teething 5 month old. I have nothing but great things to say about this $12 toy. Well worth the $$$",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,I SAW THIS MOOSE CLIPPED ONTO A CARSEAT AT MY BABY'S DAYCARE AND HAD TO HAVE IT! MY TWO MOTNH OLD LOVES IT TOO. I VIDEO TAPPED HER PETTING ITS HEAD FOR A WHOLE MINUTE! SHE LOVES THE SOFT FUR. THE ANTLERS ARE GREAT FOR TEETHING (WHEN SHE GETS OLDER) AND THE FEET CRINKLE AND RATTLE. IT REMINDS ME OF THE ROCHESTER AMERKS HOCKEY TEAM TOO ;),5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"This toy is really cute and makes great sounds, but my 4 month old has a hard time grabbing most parts of it.  The tail has rings that she can grab, but the hooves are rather large, she tries to grab the feet part instead of the legs.  The antlers that appear to be good to gnaw on are not all that easy for my daughter to get her mouth on, plus I worry about the pointier edges.  Although this is cute, bright, and has lots of different materials, there are better toys.UPDATE:  Now that my daughter is closer to 9 months, she is loving this toy.  She grabs the hooves and swings it around and really enjoys the rings on the tail.",3
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,It's a great teether and is cuddly and holds my son's attention. We take it everywhere. It also has a squeeker which helps focus his attention if he starts fussing.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"My nephew loves his moose!!!  I have not seen the product in person as it was shipped to my nephew who is in a different state but my sister tells me that he absolutely loves his toy moose.  My mom also loves the moose and feels it's an excellent age-appropriate toy that will help him grow and develop, so I am very happy with the purchase.  Thank you for delivering a GREAT product!!!!  The only thing I was surprised about and not very happy with at first was that he looks different than in the picture- his antlers are yellow and the patterns on his legs are different, and the Lamaze label is a heart, not a rectangle.. but I actually like this look better, it makes him look even more cuddly to me.  Thanks again!!!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"The Lamaze moose was a big hit for Beatrix at 6 months of age.  She loves to wave it around and of course, chew on the antlers.  It seems very well made and safe.  Plus real cute.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"I thought this was the cutest thing when our 4 month old daughter got it as a present.  Now at nearly 5 months, she loves it and enjoys chewing on it... and that's where the danger lies.  The antlers are not quite big enough to be safe.  Our daughter managed to wedge the end of the antler into her mouth, and due to the jagged shape, couldn't get it out.  She started to gag on it and couldn't get it out of her mouth.  Her face turned all red and her eyes were watering.  Luckily her mom and I were right at hand and were able to pull it out of her mouth, but we definitely won't be letting her play with it without very close supervision.Parents of toddlers and young babies, please be aware of the danger.  Because of the shape, I am pretty sure her air passage was not cut off, but it was still very scary for her and us.  I definitely do not recommend you let your child play with this toy unattended, or even in the back seat of the car, unless there's someone watching constantly.I'm sorry to give this cute and very engaging toy such a bad review, but it is simply not a safe toy.",1
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"When my baby was born this was the first toy I introduced to him. When he was about 3 months old he started to really love his ""Marty"" (We nicknamed it.) Now at 5 months, it's his buddy. He carries it around when we go from one room to another. Marty's jingly bells, and squeaker helped distract him during his 4 month vaccinations. Marty keeps him entertained in the car, and he loves chewing on Martys ears, and rings. I think that this is going to be his buddy for a long time. I think I might get the peacock too, just to see how he likes that one since he loves this one so much.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"We received Mortimer as a baby shower gift. At first I was disappointed because I wanted something cuter looking and thought he was too big. Now that our son is a little over 3 months, I love to see how much he enjoys his moose. The size is perfect for him to hug and push around. At this stage, our son likes to grab the crinkly ears and easily grabs the fabric legs. He can also manage to grab the tail rings and even somehow works his arm into the clip ring. As he learns to bring things to his mouth, Mortimer's nose and feet offer some interesting textures. He can stare at it for quite awhile with all it's colors and contrast which makes it great for car rides. We love Mr. Mortimer the Moose!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,I love how it looks but yet to be seen if baby likes it.  Let ya know in a year,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"This was my son's favorite toy from the beginning, up until about 8 or 9 months old. Now that he's a year old, he doesn't really care about it anymore. It was our go-to toy for outings. Always kept him happy. I highly recommend this toy!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"New baby still not able to use this, but heard great reviews for this toy.  Will wait for the baby to grow into this",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"Mortimer Moose is a fun, adorable baby toy. I have given them to all the babies in my life, and they are a big hit.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,My nephew is 5 months old and I got this for him for Christmas and now it is his new favorite toy. He loves to chew on the little feet and eat they antlers! This was the best money I have ever spent.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"Cute toy. Great colors and the kids love it. It's larger than expected, which is great for little hands and makes great noises.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"We love Mortimer at our house! We bought Mortimer for our son when he was 5 months old, and one year later he STILL loves Mortimer. Through a happy accident, one of his grandmothers gave him a 2nd Mortimer for Christmas last year. Morty has some terrific chewable antlers, a soft and squishy body, legs that make fun sounds, and a tail of rings to grab. During some rough teething bouts, we witnessed nearly an entire antler disappear into Gabe's mouth.Some reviewers commented on Mortimer being on the large size. When we first got Mortimer, we kept him tethered to some links on the stroller and found that our son could have fun by grabbing just a piece of the moose at a time. So yes, Morty might be a bit large for little ones to hold, but they could easily play with just a leg or an antler at a time.We now keep one in each car because Gabe loves to have Morty with him whenever he is in his carseat. We have also bought Mortimers for other little friends so they can enjoy him too!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,I bought this because I like in Alaska and we do see moose in town here. I am really impressed by all of the different fabrics with different textures as well as colors and patterns. I can attach it to the ""toy bar"" on the play yard and the bottoms of the feet are high contrast  and if the baby bats or kicks them they make sounds. the brown fur is softer than expected as well. Nice moose.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"I bought Mortimer the Moose, in part because of all the great reviews for it.  So far, I haven't figured out why so many people love him so much.  At this stage in the game, my 5 month old is mostly interested in putting things in his mouth.  The problem with Mortimer is that he's so big, that my baby isn't able to hold on to him for very long.  And Mortimer's antlers are pretty big, so I think he has teething toys that work better for that purpose.  This is the only Lamaze toy we have, so I can't compare the moose to any of the other animals the company produces.I could see that maybe he'd like the moose better as he gets older, but I wouldn't recommend the moose for small babies.",3
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,This was my son's first baby toy that he had interest in and at almost 11 months it is still the first thing that goes in his carseat with him.  We give it as a gift to everyone and have been told it is a favorite!  I find it to be so ugly that it is now cute but when your baby is happy you are happy!,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"My twin boys have Jacques the Peacock, Freddie the Firefly, and Mortimer the Moose. For some reason, Mortimer is their favorite. I think maybe because his legs and ""horns"" are easier for them to grasp (they're 4 months old). Either way, they love this toy, so we don't leave home without Mortie.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,Mortimer is great for all ages.We've been hanging it on our son's swing and play mat since he was a few weeks old. The toy is large and the build quality is very high. Mortimer is built using several different bright colors and textures. These colors draw the attention of even the youngest child. His 1 year old cousin loves to take Mortimer and chew on his ears. Since she's older she also loves his feet which are made to provide a &#34;crinkle&#34; type sound when squeezed.Highly recommended. Will purchase additional Lamaze toys.,5
Lamaze Clutch Cube Take Along Toy,Really had all the bells and whistles. It really had everything you want for your babies first toy and definitely a good buy,5
Lamaze Clutch Cube Take Along Toy,My daughter played with this from a few months old until she was 1! She liked chewing on this and it has so many little interesting things on it that kept her busy! Would buy again!,5
Lamaze Clutch Cube Take Along Toy,"My son likes playing with this cube in the car and probably will continue playing with it gleefully as he gets older (he is 4 months old, bought this when he was 2 months old).  I purchased this as a portable mirror with bonus when my son was first discovering how fun mirrors can be.  Since there are way more things on this cube than just the mirror, it has been a bonus toy in the car.  Definitely recommend.",5
Lamaze Clutch Cube Take Along Toy,"Lamaze makes a very high quality soft toy.  Like the others my grandson has been given, the Clutch Cube Baby Toy is very well made.  The seams are securely sewn.  The different fabrics offer differing tactile experiences to stimulate baby's sense of touch.  The bright colors are visually stimulating.  The hard rings are wonderful for gumming when baby's teeth are coming in.  The hidden panel which opens to reveal a mirror provides the element of surprise to entertain baby.My only criticism is that this cube is rather large and is hard for younger infants to handle.  I question whether older infants who are large enough to handle this toy will find it interesting.  For a six month old who is very interested, this toy is just too large to handle and Grandma ends up manipulating it to entertain baby.",4
Lamaze Clutch Cube Take Along Toy,The material on this is actually much prettier than it seems in the picture. My baby loves to swat at it.,5
Lamaze Clutch Cube Take Along Toy,"I purchased this for my four month old grand nephew and it has become his favorite toy. He loves the crinkling sound of the flap as well as the mirror that is exposed when the flap is raised. With all of the loops and rings, it is easy for him to hold. Highly recommend.",5
Lamaze Clutch Cube Take Along Toy,"Our baby has had this since she was 1 month old. Initially she just found it visually interesting  She is now 5 months old and adores it.  She will spend so much time turning it around, pulling at it and sucking on it.  I can take a shower or even eat a meal and she will occupy herself very contentedly.I smelled the panda side and we have no problem there.  I can only find the smell if I hunt for it, and it's a very mild green apple scent.  That is her favorite part, I guess she finds the crinkling quite tasty in her mouth.The cube is not machine washable like the inchworm, but we have done sink washings and it dries like new.When offered a choice she goes for this toy the most.  We all like it enough we added it to the must have list for baby shower gift we assemble.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Pupsqueak Take Along Toy,Well we had one for our son like 8 year ago and he loved it so we decided to get one for our daughter. She also loves it but seems like they are made cheaper cause we haven't had it long and some of the seams are already coming apart.,3
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Pupsqueak Take Along Toy,As advertised and very nice bright colors. It was true to size and nice to have the attachment to clip it on to different items while on the go. I find all of the Lamaze toys were all as advertised. Our family has purchased different animals. My grandson loves them all. Well worth the money,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Pupsqueak Take Along Toy,"I had this for my daughter when she was born almost 6 years ago (it was red then).  She LOVED it!  The barking nose doesn't work anymore, so I am ordering a new one for the baby I am expecting in a couple of months.  I was so happy when I found it again!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Pupsqueak Take Along Toy,"great toy!!! my daugther loved this toy since she was like 2 months and has not gotten tired of it since.  These toys are sooooo well made!  They say just spot wash but i have thrown it int he wash and dryer literally over 50 times and not only is it still in PERFECT condition, not a single seam has broken and the electronic barjing box in the doggie tummy still barks!!! So well made and so well loved....great toy!!!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Pupsqueak Take Along Toy,My daughter loves this puppy. It is very bright and barks and squeaks. The clip makes it east to fasten to the stroller and to ensure he doesn't get dropped or lost. I recommend any of the Lamaze toys.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Pupsqueak Take Along Toy,"We've hung this from his floor gym, and it's his favorite. So many features, noises & textures. He likes to grab at the bone and tries to chew on it.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Pupsqueak Take Along Toy,Love this. it is larger than you think it would be. It barks when you push on the nose. I think it is so cute.,5
Lamaze Multi Sensory Soft Sorter,"We have this and love it... except that the shapes have seams that tear apart easily.  I've sewn it together, but I was surprised at the construction.  They cut the fabric too close to the seam and probably should have double stitched the seam to begin with.",3
Lamaze Multi Sensory Soft Sorter,"I love this shape sorter.  My little guy is now 10 months and he understands that the shapes go into the box, and can do this with a little help as he hasn't yet figured out that the shapes are different and that they match the colour of the material on the corresponding side of the box.  I also love that is does not take batteries, and is relatively quiet so I can take it on the plane when I go home to keep him occupied.  It is all soft made of material and has 4 different shapes to sort. There are some small sounds. It is well made, well designed and very good value for money. Highly recommended.",5
Lamaze Multi Sensory Soft Sorter,"My son loves the shapes, sound and colors. not old enough to understand to put the blocks in the corresponding holes",5
Lamaze Multi Sensory Soft Sorter,"My son still enjoys the Einstein shape sorter from 2 months onward; he began by staring at the colorful fabrics, batting the 'blocks', holding them, and taking them out of the sorter by 6 mos.  The sphere served as a good first ball for play and he wrestles the sorter.  Now at 6 mos. I place each shape in the correct opening and he pushes it in -- great for in/out concepts, depth perception, sound variety.  Although the patterns are a little loud there's a different one for every mood, to calm or stimulate, and good textures.  A great investment for unstructured play!",5
Lamaze Multi Sensory Soft Sorter,"I thought she would love this, not so much.  She touched it a couple times and was just not interested.  She has had it from 6-9 mos. and still nothing.  O'well, can't win them all.",3
Lamaze Multi Sensory Soft Sorter,"This is a great idea, a soft shape sorter. The pieces are perfect for little hands, and each one has its own unique sound.",5
Lamaze Multi Sensory Soft Sorter,"This is a high quality, educational toy. I bought it for my 6 month old grand-son, and he and his mother both liked it. It is soft, so she put it in his crib.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"My son is usually cranky when we take him out to run errands. When I showed him Jacque the Peacock, he became immediately calm. He stared and smiled at the peacock. We now make sure this toy is with us at all times when running errands. What a great way to pacify a 2-month old infant!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,Our 6 month old daughter loves to play with Jacques because of the texture and the crinkly sound of the fabric.  She's had this toy since she was 4 months and is still playing with it!,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"I put this toy on my baby's changing table when she was just a few weeks old and she loved staring at it.  Now, by daughter is 6 months old and she still loves playing with it... it was definitely worth buying!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"My son has heart issues so we have always been very careful about letting him get too worked up. This ""psychedelic bird"" as we call him has almost always been able to calm him down when he's upset, or distract him when he's starting to get there. Not sure if it's the colors, the mirror or the texture, but this guy always keeps him happy.I recently sent one to a friend in China who had a baby, and he said it works just as well with her - always stops her from crying.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"I bought this for my daughter when she was just two weeks old because she was mesmerized by black and white patterns, and this guy has several different b&w; designs on the back of his ""feathers.""  She loved to stare at them, and would often focus on his bright red bottom.  I loved that the link would clip onto her baby gym so that we could dangle him above her.  Then, once her color vision improved, she was fascinated by the bright colors on the front side of Jacques' feathers and began to reach for him and swat at him.Now that she's four months old, she really likes the different fabric textures, and enjoys grabbing at the feathers and touching them.  The link is still really useful, because it allows us to clip him to her carrier or diaper bag.  That way, he's always handy, but can't get lost like a few other unfortunate (and missed!) toys have.Overall, Jacques has held up well as my daughter has grown from a tiny newborn to a curious infant.  I'm really pleased that she continues to find new ways to play with him.",4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,This is my 2 month old son's favorite toy.  He will stare at it endlessly and shaking it soothes him when he cries.  Don't know what we'd do without this peacock!,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"I got this for my new niece, and my sister (her mom) said it's her favorite toy. My sister liked the softness and the colors. She said it's a great texture toy and was very happy I got it for her baby. I think it's too cute, too. :)",4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"This is on of the greatest toys it is so colorfull and a nice size to, it is my sons favorite toy he loves it and started really playing with it at 3 months by kicking at it and grabbing for it and loves to chew on it we cannot go out without it.  get it you will not be disapointed.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"I read the reviews that other kids loved this toy...so I bought it. I attached it to one of the activity gyms and waited for my son to take notice. Finally he did and he LOVES it! It took him a few weeks, but now he loves the peacock. In fact he roughs him up a little..always squeezing him, sucking on his nose, and playing with it, very cute! The peacock has so many features that he loves, he keeps comming back to him again and again. Definately a good buy.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,Wonderful toy!! It is great with the black and white with red on the back side for intial few months.  Then as your child gets older you can turn it to the front and they can play with everything.  The different textures on the front are great as well as the squeaker in the toy.  My daughter loves Jacque and looking at him as well as grasping the crinkly feathers.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"I bought for my daughter, who is expecting baby and she loved it. Very colorful and very beautiful. On-time delivery and very good price",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"After spending a significant amount of time toy shopping, I settled on the Lamaze Peacock.  My son is 3 months old and he has been playing with this toy for over a month...every day.  It hooks easily to his car seat, his play mat, and it is easy for him to grab and hold.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"We own several of the play and grow toys, my baby and I are just in LOVE with them all but Jacques is the most educational of them all! He is perfect for teaching my baby about touch, sound, cause & effect, has a mirror for her to check her cute little face out, little tags to lick on and the back is the BEST ever!!! It has awesome bold contrasting black and white patterns that is the only thing that seems to grab my newborns attention & calms her during the dreaded tummy time!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,the bird itself is solid and not very flexible so it wasn't as easy to play with but my son liked the ""feathers"" well enough.,3
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"AT 3 months Jacques made my daughter smile and giggle. She loved him ...it was adorable. Now she is 6 months and Jacques no longer interest her ...but it was good while it lasted. I highly recommend this product. However, the lamaze products all seem the same ...I would not buy to many of them.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,My  baby is fond of the wings of the peacock.And he touches the wings and plays with it often.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"I own various Lamaze toys and this one is, by far, my favourite. The back has black/white patterns that are high contrast for when they are young and their vision is poor. It's also large enough that the baby can see it and start batting at it at a young age. There's a mirror, squeaky toy, and crinkly sounds wrapped into one toy. I hang this off the activity gym and it's not so heavy that it's a problem.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,Looks as it should and works perfectly. Will purchase from seller again. Will recommend to friends. She's not that old but loves the toy so far.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"My son loves grabbing onto the texture section. Just the crinkle feathers are enough to keep him interested. Granted he's only four months, and he just recently gained interest in toys, but he always likes the toy when I put it in front of him; always reaching for it. About the product itself, GREAT colours--exactly as it shows in the photo. Great quality. The peacock's ""bum"" is made of bean bag material so you can prop it up on its bum to stand by itself. I've seen the peacock wing activity things in different colours, while the peacock stays green, the orange squeaker can become yellow, while the sun can become purple (stuff like that). If you're particular about colours, check other stores to see what they have. Also, the mirror is pretty clear as well. Overall, awesome product. Have had it for months and still no threads pulling out, nothing. Good stuff!!!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"I purchased Jacques because I wanted a plush toy for my infant sons carseat.  I had been given other car seat toys but they had too many hard pieces and I was worried that in the event of an accident they could cause injuries.  Jacques is nice and soft and my son loves him.  At first (2months) he just loved to look at him and maybe grab his feathers and crinkle them.  Now (at 3 months) he wants me to take the toy down so he can grab it and chew on the crinkly wings.  The bright colors are great, he loves the mirror and squeaker too.**ETA: one thing I am not liking is the clip.  It hangs it a little to high in his carseat and it is a little difficult to take on and off, I might prefer an alligator type clip instead.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"Got this toy for my 2 month old baby girl and it's wonderful. It has textures, bright colors, and noises to keep her busy. It's a great toy for taking on the go because you're able to attach it to a carseat or stroller very easily. Also, it's extremely cute so you can't go wrong with this toy!!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,I was very pleased with the Lamaze Peacock. It is very colorful and has a lot of different textures on it which is very ineresting for my granddaughter. I would definitley purchase this product again!,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,Should have gone with the firefly. Jacques is hard for my 5 month old to hold. Doesn't stand up too well on its own either.,3
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"I bought this for my daughter while my wife bought the butterfly: turned out that our little sunshine likes the peacock the most... Daddy knows best! :) Joking apart, two great toys for child development and fun.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,This is my 6 month old's new favorite toy.  He likes the crinkly noise and the many colors.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,i bought this for my daughter when she was a little over a month old and she has loved it from day one! she's always grabbing the feathers and trying to eat the nose and feet. best money i've spent on a toy!!,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,My baby is 5 weeks and was taking a little longer to focus her eyes on people when she is held. But as soon as I attached Jaques to her crib she immediately looked at him and interacted with him. Focusing on the bright colors and looking directly at him! I have noticed marked improvement with her looking at me and following me with her eyes! I highly recommend this toy it is every bit worth the money!,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"Dont know what was the hype all about. Bought this for my son, he chews it like any other items I would offer to him otherwise nothing special about it. He's almost 5 months old",2
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"I have never written a review before but my daughter loves this thing so much that I had to come on and rave about it. Jacques goes with us everywhere. He hangs from her car seat when we're out, and he hangs from her playmat when she's on there in the morning. Throughout the day I will give him to her just to hold. She absolutely loves him and will giggle when I flap his wings for her. She's four months old and has had him for about a month. I would recommend him to anybody!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"Jacques is just the friend to stimulate your little one's senses.  The bright colors attract and maintain his attention.  The small size is ideal for a little one to hold and inspect.  The wings, which contain some type of crinkle, sound-producing material, encourage grasping and squeezing to develop those finger and hand muscles.  The rattle encourages Baby to learn that shaking Jacques will result in a noise - teaching cause and effect.  It also provides valuable physical activity to develop arm muscles.  The mirrored wing allows Baby to peek at himself and to explore the wonders of self-awareness.Jacques is imitated; I saw a similar item at the ""bull's eye"" store which was one-third the cost, but was also inferior in quality.  I certainly would not recommend purchasing it since it did not seem to be as well-made as Jacques.  If you are going to purchase a toy for an infant you love, stick with the Lamaze Jacques the Peacock.  You won't be disappointed and neither will Baby.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"This is very nice, colorful, bright toy. It makes sounds when you shake it and when you touch it. Sounds were a first thing that attracted my son's attention in this toy. Very bright different colors made him stair at it for hours; it actually made him fall asleep. It's a very nice toy to have starting from 2 month old.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,This cute little peacock sure keeps my little one busy. She makes it crinkle and crunch and just loves the baby mirror. I would definitely recommend this product for a developing baby.,4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"My 4 month old LOVES this peacock. I've named her Penny. We take Penny with us out and about and she just sits in her carseat crinkling the ""wings"" and chewing on them. It keeps her entertained with great, bright colors and lots of different textures and fabrics. Would highly recommend! Also have the Musical Inchworm by lamaze which she also really likes, but this one is her fave, and easier to tote around with the ring.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"I don't know if it's just my baby or the toy, but my baby doesn't pay much attention to it and prefers to play with other toys. It is a fun toy though and has a lot of fun colors and features.",4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"My 2 month old daughter LOVES Jacques. She holds onto his ""feathers"" and loves the noise the crinkle noise makes. We attached him onto her carseat so  she can play with him while we travel. She loves to stare at his bold colors. We also turn him around so she views the back of Jacques, which is all black and white patterns. Jacques is such a good friend to my daughter.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"I bought this before my son was born, he has almost all of the other Lamaze and other brands that are built similar and as soon as his hands began to grasp objects he hasn't put them all down. He is 9 months old now and still slobs all over them. Good buy!!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,beautiful and amazing gift for an infant. own this product and other ones made by Lamaze. I Highly recommend this product and other ones from the same company.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"I bought it for a child who is visually impaired and he doesn't seem to like it as much as I do, but it's a good size, it has lots of color, and there are different things he can put in his mouth.",4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,Baby loves this.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,My son loves this toy. He plays with it all the time. It has been a life saver in the car.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,Such a cute little peacock. My 3 yr old loves to entertain my 2 month old with this toy. So cute.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"We gave Jacques the peacock to our daughter when she was a newborn. At first it was a great attention grabber, and she would stare at it for awhile... she often fell asleep looking at the black-and-white patterns. Then she started reaching for it, and exploring the textures and the sounds. Now at 6 months old this is still one of her favorite toys. She drools all over it, plays with his feet and 'feathers', and loves the crinkle sounds it makes. Highly recommend this.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,This has been my sons favorite since he was 2 months!! The only toy he smiles and giggled at! He loves to grab it and feel everything. I even took it on a flight to keep entertained! Worked perfect!!,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"This is another really cute toy by Lamaze, but our baby was not really interested. She prefers some of the other ones in this line more, so we sent this one back. Brightly coloured and well designed, I would recommend it, though!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"My son, almost 10 weeks old, loves this toy! It was a baby shower gift and he has been interested in looking at the black and white patterns pretty much since birth. Now that he is a bit older, he is really enjoying the more colorful side. There is so much to explore - tactile, color, sound, etc. - he loves Jacques every time he sees him! Highly recommended and a great gift, too!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"My 3 month old daughter LOVES this toy. The bright colors on the front, the black and white contrast on the back, and the crinkly sound it makes all fascinate her.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"My daughter told me that when my 7 month old daughter saw the rattle, first she LOVED the box and played with it for awhile.  Then when she got the rattle she was enthralled.  My daughter was very happy it was a lamaze product.  I will buy more of those!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"I was checking out the cool features on the toy the day it arrived and literally after squeezing the squeaker three times it stopped working!  I also bought the firefly one and the squeaker on it is still working, so maybe they are hit or miss?  Not worth the hassle of sending back, so guess I'm out of luck.  Buyer beware!",2
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,Our son loves his peacock.  The crinkle sounds and the mirrors really keep his attention.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,This was an excelent toy for my one year old.It kept him bussy for a long time. i got it as agift adn bought several for gifts as ell - it works great especially for the price,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"I think this is a great toy , my 4 month old likes to chew on it, when he does it makes crinkling sounds, it is very colorful to look at so it holds his attention for a while, It is a little big for him now , but he'll grow into it in a couple of months.",4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"My neice loves its and thats all that matters to me, but it's not as big as it looks in the picture",3
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,My 5 month old nephew loves this toy.  It keeps him busy.  Many colors and shapes and sounds of paper crinkle helps him with development.,4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"This is a great first toy for a little baby.  My boy loves looking into Jaques' eyes while I change his diaper and loves to reach out and touch him, very well made.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"My son's first favorite toy that he liked when only 2-3 months old and still likes four months later. He loves to chew on the feathers, squeals with delight over the squeaking feather, and loves the myriad colors and textures. The handy Lamaze clip on top means it can be attached to car seats, activity centers, strollers, or baby carriers, and the product has beena ble to withstand tons of baby drool and chewing.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"Now at 7-8 weeks my baby is love with this toy! She giggles and coos whenever she sees it! This toy holds her attention for some time because of the colorful side, black and white side, taggies, rattles, squeaky, etc! Great developmental toy!!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,My son is 6 months old.  He enjoys playing and chewing on the wings.  The peacock has different textures for him to feel and has nice bright colors.  The back is black and white.  Each wing has different shape patterns.,4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"I bought this for my grand-daughter because all the Amazon reviews stated customers were so happy with their purchase.  My 3 month old grand-daugher seems to like it.  I did not realize that she had 2 other Lamaze figures.  She smiles, laughs, and talks to them when she's in her swing or rocker.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"Our 5 month old has been enjoying this since he could focus his eyes! It hangs from the 'passenger handle' in the car and dangles in front of his car seat. He bats at it and stares at it. We've also clipped a pacifier to it -- so he can even grab and munch on the pacifier. As a baby who doesn't enjoy being in the car seat, this is a GREAT distraction and gives you a couple minutes until you reach the magic 45 mph to lull the baby to sleep. :)",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"Its an amazing colorful toy, but we just bought morty the moose, and she likes it reguardless of the color factor, it also had better teether places, the peacock has just its wings which all have the same textures, the little green circle has the squeek, v.s morty which his hole side body is eaisly touched n squeeks, the ball is so small in this toy it makes a sound just not as eaisy or as loud! If your wanting flashy colors this is it, if your wanting teething/ entertainment quality morty is the one to go with.. but for a while Lilly liked looking at this wings and colors which the back wings has different patterns of black n white swirls! OVER ALL IT IS A GREAT TOY.. JUST NOT THE BEST LAMAZE IN MY OPINION!",4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"This toy was one of the first that our baby liked as an infant.  So much, in fact, that I kept it stored away because he helped us through many car rides and dinners out.  We consider Jacques to be part of the family, even though he's in a storage box, now.  He kept the baby's attention and she loved playing with his ""crinkle"" wings and sucking on his face.  Other similar toys just didn't cut the muster compared to Jacques.  He was her first love.  I thought I'd try the other Lamaze toys, which are similar to Jacques...I think I had the Moose and something else, but she didn't care for them.  Something about Jacques was mysterious and intruiging to our infant.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"My newborn child loves to look and try to grab this toy. I wanted to point out that the rear side of this toy has white and black fabric on it with different designs. Perfect for a newborns eye's, as they love the difference in contrast. The peacock ""feathers"" have a crunchy sounding material inside. So a child is instantly rewarded with a noise when the toy is touched. Also, the orange ball on the left ""feather"" makes a squeaking noise when pressed. Oh, the feathers are stiff, and they do not flop over,which may actually detour some people from buying this toy as it is NOT like a stuffed animal. The right side feathers are made of different textured materials, great for sensory processing. It also says on the tag that it is machine washable. Hope this helps potential buyers:>",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,I ordered this for a Christmas gift.  Came very quickly and he is really cute.  I have no clue how the baby will like it but it seems well made.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"I have no idea why but my son adores this toy.  He loved this toy months before he even noticed other toys.  It was one of the few things that would keep him happy in the car (he hates the carseat).  We have two other similar Lamaze toys and while he likes them too, they did not have the same effect as this one.  I think it's the large eyes.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,ring on top fits infant carrier and also on play yard. multiple textures keeps my 7 month old busy for hours. great for travel! back side has high contrast black and white for infants - only wish i would have bought when my baby was younger! great value!,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"Not really comfortable toy. My 4,5 month old don't get interested in it at all and when she eventually grabs it - it's so obviously uncomfortable for her to play with it, that she quits in few seconds. Not to mention that it looks more like turkey, not peacock :)",2
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"Very colorful and playful toy.  My baby girl who is 14 weeks old enjoys swatting at it when hung over her while on her playmat.  She likes the crinkly noise and likes to eat its little beak. I wished it had more things for her to hold on because it has those wide flat panels (wings of the bird) and it's hard for a little one my age to grab onto it.  It is nice that the back side of the toy is also interesting so even when it's turned there's something for my baby to look it.  The squeaky green button is useless because it is not a soft button so babies aren't able to press down on it to make the noise.  The plastic ring is great for you to hang on a playmat or a baby carrier but wished it was detachable because when she sits on m lap to play with it, the ring gets in the way and it's hard plastic so I'm afraid she might get hurt from it.",4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,The only toy my 2 month old likes.  It calms her down and fascinates her.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,So colorful and entertaining for a baby.  Hangs anywhere with the attached ring.  Great for a baby's visual senses and eye hand coordination.  Love to give this as a baby shower gift.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"Our little girl loves Jacques the Peacock!  We have him attached to her gym and she stares and bats at him all the time.  The peacock has engaging colors, a ""squeak"" feather and a ""crackle"" feather.  I'm glad Amazon has priced it right since it can be expensive elsewhere.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,This was the first Lamaze product that we bought for our 5+ month old son.  This toy is quite impressive.  Each wing is it's own visual adventure and offers a unique scheme for your child to focus on.  Jaques also has a different black and white design on the back of each wing.  His wings have gift wrapping paper (or something similar) inside each of his wings which provides a loud crunching sound whenever my little guy grabs him.  The bottom of the toy is flat and weighted so you can sit him up if desired.  Overall I have been very pleased with the design and quality of this toy.  My wife and I would highly recommend Jacques to anyone and will definitely be trying out more Lamaze products in the future!,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"Purchased this as a gift for my 5 month old grandaughter at Christmas time. She loves it, especially the crunchy noise it makes! And she loves the mirror! It's easy for her to pick up and play with!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"My 3 month old son loves this toy! We wanted to get him something to stimulate him to reach for things and this toy did it...we attached it to his play yard and within days he was mesmerized and batting at it, yay!! Great toy.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"My daughter loves this toy, keeps her occupied, especially in the car.  Sometimes she gets ""mad"" at it, but it overall is great.  Love that it has two sides, very nice to break up the monotony or if it falls she isnt screaming to have it put back the other way. We got it when she was 3 months old, now she is 5 months and still likes it a lot.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"I bought 4 Lamaze toys based on their 5 stars reviews, Buzz the Bug, Freddie the Firefly, Mortimer the Moose, and Jacques the Peacock. They are all beautiful and good quality and all have teething rings, squeakers, crinkles, and rattles. BUT to be honest Jacques the Peacock beats them all so easily, my baby only cares about jack. When she was born I show her the High contrast Black and White dots on jack's wings, and she was so mesmerized for several minutes.. While I agree that all Lamaze baby products are good and worth buying, but I think 1 or 2 is enough.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"Our daughter is crazy about Jacques - she loves the crinkly sound his feathers make and will grab onto those all day.  She also loves grinning at herself in the little mirror, and making the rattling and squeaking sounds.  I love that it clips onto her car seat or her door jumper, so she can play with it wherever she goes and can't just toss it onto the floor.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"Baby is just under 2 months and pretty much sleeps all the time, but when she wakes up this keeps her attention.  Recommend it highly.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"The color, the crinkly sound, the different textures my little niece cannot get enough out of these toys. I been buying the whole collection because they are adorable and very interactive for her. Soft to the touch and the quality how its made is great.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"Purchased this when my daughter was about 5 mo. old and it never really caught on with her. She played with it (seemed to like the parts that &#34;crackle&#34; and liked when I squeaked the squeaker) for maybe 5 minutes and then once she could crawl and choose toys to play with she never was interested in it again. Rattles were much more of a hit with her from age 3 - 7 mo., so buying this toy was kind of a waste. I'm keeping it for my next little one that's on the way, and maybe he or she will like it better.",3
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"I used the have this dangling from her carseat, but it is a tad large, so I relocated it to her evenflow megasaucer.  She just stared at it on her carseat (she was younger then though, now she's 4 months old), but now have smaller toys for that. So have this attached to her evenflow megasaucer via the chain link toys for infants and this makes the toy easily reachable plus won't fall on the ground when she drops it..it just dangles over the side (so it stays clean).  She gets so angry when this thing falls too.  She loves chewing the ""feathers"".  She just goes to town and this toy gets drenched!!  Cute toy and the hook is awesome so you can attach it to anything really.  I have other toys that are easily reachable on the megasaucer as well, but it seems like this is her favorite..I think it is the crinkle sound that she is drawn to. This will keep her busy in her megasaucer for a while, so I can get stuff done; she's a needy baby too. Anyways..cool toy, lots of colors and textures and you can hook to anything.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"I love all the colors, the squeaker, and just how well made this product is... I can't wait for my son's arrival in July so I can see what he thinks of this beautiful toy too!:) Exciting!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,I highly recommend this baby toy to every parent. Both of my children have loved Jacques the Peacock and I always buy this toy for expectant parents/baby shower gift. There are so many cool & stimulating features of this toy including the mirror and the bright colors. Enjoy!,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"I am a nanny for a 5 month old boy who has loved Jacques for months, and still does. This was the favorite toy to stare at when he was real little. Now that he can hold things and manipulate them, this is still his favorite. He loves the crinkly parts. There really is a lot to this toy and it has been useful for a while now and I think will stay fun for a few more months. Definitely a thumbs up!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"I use this as my daughters stroller toy, the colors are bright and beautiful. I love the different textures of he toy. I would recommend this toy.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,Everyone needs little Jacques at their house. All my kids love this funny little baby toy. I bought it for my newest baby girl. She loves the colors on the front and the black and white patterns on the back. It is great for newer and older babies. Great buy!,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"Yet another great product by lamaze.  Our son loves the peacock, he plays with it all the time.  We clip it on to his carseat, jungle gym, and anythng else we can.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,I got this toy for a 1 year baby and she loved it. The Tail is the fun part because each feather have a different texture.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"I absolutely love these things!  use them in daycare setting since not all children have things like this to bring from home... they're inexpensive enough to be used individually & well worth the entertainment factor!  crinkly, satiny, mirror, textures with lots of thingies for little hands & fingers to explore.... NEVER had a little one not wild about it since they 'mouth' everything to explore their world--",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,This toy has a lot of little features on it. It is perfect for little hands and to be able to hang on the carseat.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"We saw this in Babies-R-Us and our little baby couldn't stop laughing when she saw it.  I think it's the combination of the BIG EYES, the squeaker in one of the wings, the mirror in another wing, the krinkly sounds and the bright colors.The hook on top is useful for hanging from the carseat or from the swing --  however, if you are just trying to make Jacque dance for your baby, the hook kind of gets in the way but that is a minor note.Overall, I highly recommend Jacque --  she has not tired of him yet and everytime she sees good ol' Jacque, her face lights up and she babbles at him.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"My daughter loves this! She is 5 months old and she can't get enough of it! She loves the bright colours and the noises it makes, and I love that I can clip it onto her car-seat so that I don't lose it and for her continuous play!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,My son loves biting on Jacques wings while in the car and out and about. We have it clipped to his infant carrier so he has Jacques everywhere we go.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,We have both the Lamaze Jacques the Peacock and the Lamaze Freddie the Firefly. The baby instantly took to the firefly absolutely loving it from 3 months to 6 months. The peacock was much harder for him to hang on to and despite being similar in style was ignored. If I had a choice I would go for the firefly instead...Lamaze Freddie the Firefly,2
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"My 4 month old loves her Jacques the Peacock.  I was plesantly surprised when it arrived that it was larger than I had expected, but yet still is the perfect size for my baby to pull into her mouth.  She loves the krinkly material in the wings, and all the different features.  I love that it keeps her occupied in the car oor laying on the floor for long periods of time.  This is my third baby, and the peacock is one of my favorite infant toys I have had for any of my children.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,My daughter is 2 months old and started tracking everything lately.  I have other toys but this one...is by far her favorite. I got this guy because of the other positive reviews....get it.  I LOVE how colorful this little guy is and on the backside is black and white geometric shapes that hold her attention.  Babies see black and white better then colors for the first few months so Lamaze was smart to add this to a usual &#34;empty&#34; space.  We named her little guy Percy...and she will smile and coo at him everytime she sees him. She loves just staring at this little guy. By far the best toy,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,My sister's kid likes it a lot! It is very suitable for those new born infants. I am glad that I bought this.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"This item was cute. the 1 month old was interested in the black and white back , however the crinkly sound that it makes scared him (although ive read kids like it elsewhere) overall, a very cute toy to put on a stroller or a crib",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"This is a great toy that my 4 yr old with autism adores.  It would be perfect if there wasn't so much crinkly paper in it, and the label looks horrible placed where it is.  I hope the makers of these toys read this because I would like them to know I spend hours ripping every last one of their labels out.  It's not just a toy, it also doubles as an advertisement!",4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,My baby boy loves this peacock! He has played with him everyday for about a month. He is 4 months old and loves to see Jacque 'flying"" through the air. He is very colorful and easy for him to handle. I also like him because he is big enough that he does not fall out of his carrier.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"The peacock is the greatest toy ever created for 0-24 months old babies.  Both of our boys love it.  It is especially wonderful for the babies who are transitioning to being more social and is a wonderful toy for tummy time.  Whatever keeps your babies happy is a great toy in  We got it originally for our first baby from friends of ours, and we are now buying for my former's boss's baby.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,Jacque captures my 5 week old's gaze and I think that it is very cute. The back side of the peacock features black and white patterned fabrics that are very high contrast to allow very young infants to focus on them. I think that this is a great toy for little young ones. He rattles and squeeks. He also has a mirror patch so that the little one can see her beautiful reflection!,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,We are big fan's of Lamaze toys. Our daughter loves each one we've gotten her and this one is no exception. Jacques is designated for the car seat and she is so excited to see him when it's time to go. Definitely a must have for us!,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"This should be the first toy people buy for their baby because it is the first one they will have any use for.  The back if the wings that are not shown in the stock photo are black and white geometric patterns that even small infants are drawn to.  I was a nanny to a lot of different babies over the years and from 4 weeks to 14 months, babies love this thing.  It is easy to travel with and it provides endless entertainment.  It is the first toy I see infants reach for because of those black and white patterns on the back and it continues to keep them entertained throughout their development because of the bright colors, various textures and various sounds it makes when it is grabbed by little hands.  Makes a great gift!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,Our daughter has been enamored with Jacques since she was 2 months old.  At almost 6 months she still reaches for him and enjoy his pretty colors and crinkly feathers.  This is the only toy that can hold her attention for long periods of time.  She does not like any of the other Lamaze toys (including the turtle whose mirror is too hard for an infant).,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,I think we got this for her at 3 months- she never seems to get tired of looking at it or playing with it.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"This toy is awesome and will surely be enjoyed by our daughter for years to come (will appeal to infants and toddlers alike).Some key features:- Lower left orange ball is a squeaker- Lower right layered &#34;feathers&#34; all different textures, including crinkly- upper right has a mirror- upper left has a rattle-like elementVery cute toy, we like to attach it to baby's car seat and stroller to keep her entertained.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"This is a great toy for a small child, under 1 year.  My nephew is entertained by it for extended periods because it crinkles (noise) and is exactly the right size for him to grip.  He also likes the colors.  However, I like that it is small, so it can hang in the mini crib without taking too much space and he wakes up with a friendly toy that makes him happy and calm.  It also hangs from his carrier and the stroller strap.  Excellent buy.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"My Granddaughter is just 3 months old and is very happy to see her new toy....Its true to description, very colorful and a fair price...I would recommend buying this....it is of good quality...",4
Lamaze Puppytunes,"I bought this for my special needs daughter and she enjoys the colors, scent and the noise the legs make when squeezing them.  I was wondering if the red rear leg was defective though because it barely squeeks when she squeezes it?  I can get it to work better because I have bigger hands and can squeeze it harder.  Either way it's making her current hospital stay a little better since this toy distracts her during play.",4
Lamaze Puppytunes,"cute idea, only four notes, so ""tunes"" are very limited. Children have a hard time getting the toy to play notes because to get sound to come out you have to squeeze pretty hard, quickly, which is impossible for a small child. Save your money and buy something else.",2
Lamaze Octotunes Musical Toy,"This toy is a good idea and it's very cute and smells great when you first purchase it.  I gave it to my son at 9 months and, unfortunately, it has never interested him (it's still out in his room and he doesn't look twice at it).  I would show this toy to a child before purchasing it since it's not a sure hit with all kids as far as I'm concerned.",2
Lamaze Octotunes Musical Toy,"We've only had the toy a couple of days and I don't know who likes it more - me or my 4 month old.  He can't squeeze the tentacles yet.  The are pretty hard, and even make my hand hurt after awhile.  But, my son has a huge smile on his face while I play.  I didn't buy it for him myself because I thought it was too big.  But, he doesn't seem to mind.  Only comes with two songs.  I'm musical, so that's not a problem.  But my sister-in-law has asked me to write a little songbook for her for her son and his Octotunes.",4
Lamaze Octotunes Musical Toy,"My five month old grandson and 10 month old granddaughter both love this toy.  If given a choice, they reach for this first.  Highly recommend.",5
Lamaze Octotunes Musical Toy,"Colorful and cute, however, Very large octopus legs and very difficult to squeeze for music. I got it for our 3 month old grandson but even our 20 month old grandson could not squeeze the legs. I sent it back.",2
Lamaze Octotunes Musical Toy,I didn't realize the tentacles were horns when I purchased it-- I thought they were electric touch-sensors.  I like the horns much more since batteries are not required and I know it will not break easily.  My 4-month old son cannot squeeze the tentacles to make the noises (yet) but I'm having so much fun playing it for him!  He loves the different textures and colors of the fabrics.  I've already purchased two more for friends.,5
Lamaze Octotunes Musical Toy,"My (very strong and big for her age) 10-month-old wants to make music so badly with her octopus but the legs don't toot so easily--it takes a strong (adult) hand to make music. Does anyone else have that problem or do we just have a dud? She's had this since birth and has just shown an interest in it in the past month or two. It's a big toy for an infant, heavy and not easily dragged around. I wish it responded to her squeezes. Again, she's got a strong grip but gets frustrated with it pretty fast.",2
Lamaze Octotunes Musical Toy,"My 2 month old loves this ocotpus.  He stares at it and when we play music, he'll laugh and talk. When he's crying on his swing or in his carseat, we'll just plop it on his lap and he'll stop and stare and start talking.  Its so cute.  It doesn't always work but it works often enough that it is already worth the price.  It is a great way to play with your baby.I don't mind the limited music library as I can make up my own tunes and the baby doesn't care if you're off key.The only thing that is bothersome is some of the legs are hard to squeeze to make sounds even for adults which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.",4
Lamaze Octotunes Musical Toy,"I really don't see the big deal about this toy, and neither does my 10 month old.  He's not the least bit interested in it, and I've shown him that the legs make sounds.  He doesn't care.  I think it was a waste of money.  Oh well.",2
Lamaze Octotunes Musical Toy,"It's great, cute and well designed. My grandson loves it. Highly recommend for musical notes in feet.",5
Lamaze Octotunes Musical Toy,"This toy was given to me at my shower. It is definitely a cute toy with bright colors and I am sure the baby will want to play with it. However, I wish that the tentacles used electronic technology instead of air, as it takes some force to get the horns inside to actually play a tune. My four-year-old son has trouble consistently getting them to make noise, so I don't see how a younger child would ever be able to play with the musical notes. Seems like a waste to make a cute musical toy that a child can't play with fully, that seems to always require adult intervention.This toy is also supposedly pleasantly scented, but to me it smells like very sugary cake icing and is a bit much. It's too sweet and cloying and for now it's been stuck in a back room in the hopes that it will air out over the next few weeks. I know babies are sweet, but it doesn't seem like a great idea to have something so scented around new babies that might have skin sensitivities to such things. I think it's wise to skip scenting baby toys.I gave it three stars still because it IS a cute toy that babies/children can play with, and I LOVE the crinkle handle. But I wouldn't buy it if you want it for the music part of it.",3
Lamaze Octotunes Musical Toy,"While the reviewer who said it is not very easy to squeeze the arms to create notes is correct, it is still an excellent toy and my son loves it. He loves to squeeze the entire toy and I imagine that by 1 year he should have no problem squeezing the arms himself. When he is fussy I start making some simple music and he loves it.pros:1) Great introduction to musical notes, especially if you are musically inclined and can name the notes2) Excellent colors3) No Batteries4) smells good. I has a strong vanilla smell although I do worry how it has that smell (I assume some not so friendly chemicals but I do not know for sure)5) Large! Not some tiny toy that a kid can just throw aroundCons:1) A little difficult to squeeze the arms for a very young child. 12 months and over is probably the average age that a baby will be able to create notes themselves.That's really all...great toy!",5
Lamaze Octotunes Musical Toy,Countless hours of fun - for children and adults!  Great quality (I have another one that is already 7 years old & looks like new).,5
Lamaze Octotunes Musical Toy,"It was just as good as described, if not better.  My young grandson loved it. His parents love that it requires no batteries.",5
Lamaze Octotunes Musical Toy,My 10 months old son loves it. He can't make it sound right now (the toy is a bit big for him and the arms need to be pressed quickly and hard) but that give us chance to play with it together. If you have some music playing knowledge this toy makes a great choice as you can perform some lullabies with its arms (my son really enjoys when I play a know song with this toy).,5
Lamaze Octotunes Musical Toy,"I like the toy and what it can do, but when I received it, it had a strong vanilla scent.  I thought it would go away once I aired it out, but it's still lingering.  I thought it might just be the toy that I received, but I've smelled other ones in stores and it has the same strange vanilla scent.",3
Lamaze Octotunes Musical Toy,Both my 1 yr.old grandsons love this!  They really like the &#34;face&#34; and are drawn to it like a happy face.  My 3 yr grandson also enjoyed it and everyone fight to play with it!,5
Lamaze Octotunes Musical Toy,This colorful octopus is great for entertaining the little tike in your family. The music is made by squeezing the tentacles. The little tikes will have trouble on their own since it takes a good squeeze to produce the sound. Colorful and larger than I asuumed when I saw the photo on the web.,3
Lamaze Octotunes Musical Toy,"My wife and I (yep a guy reviewing a kids toy!) bought this as a present for our 7 month old niece. She is absolutely hooked on it. Having a relatively short attention span with most toys, it was rewarding to see how much she likes it and how long it entertains her. Just squeezing the musical tentacles for her keeps her happy! The big doe eyes have her mesmerized as well. When she gets bored, learning to play tunes keeps the adults happy!!Playing is easy, you get two color coded tunes on the label and with the help of a musical friend we know a lot more now.With my wife 4 months pregnant, we have ordered another already.Only reason for 4 stars is the one we bought had trouble playing the lowest note (red tentacle!).",5
Lamaze Octotunes Musical Toy,I thought this would be more musical- its a squeek toy - I kept it because it was colorful and cute but was disapointed.,3
Lamaze Octotunes Musical Toy,"We found Octy (he was so cute that we nicknamed him immediately) in a lovely toy shop and bought him for our new grandson, although the toy was not packaged and was a bit heavy. Within days, Octy's notes became off-key: either flat or sharp. Months later, we found a shelf of Octotunes toys, also with no wrapping or packaging, at another toy store, but each of them had at least one sour note! Finally, at a third shop, we exchanged Octy for Octy2. Within a week, all his notes became sour, too! We are quite disappointed, since we usually are pleased with LaMaze toys.",2
Lamaze Octotunes Musical Toy,"I bought this for my 4 month old daughter.  She kept staring at it as soon as it was put in front of her.  Its near on impossible for a young baby to get a tune out of the arms (more for adult than even a one year old), but all the same, its brought lots of amusement, has a lovely vanilla scent to it and my daughter gets very excited when I play 'twinkle little star' to her on it.  She's now nearly 6 months and its one of her favourite toys.  She also tends to frequently lay on her tummy talking to him, always goes towards him when on her playmat and plays with his black and white frills on each arm. Money well spent as when other children come round they also seem to take a shine to it, ranging from 2 year olds to 5 year olds!  Another great toy from Lamaze.",5
Lamaze Octotunes Musical Toy,"I got this toy originally for my firstborn (now 4) and now my second (6 months) has been introduced to it, and neither kid has been too interested. Both kids initially liked the look of it (it's really cute, brightly colored and sturdy, and big for a baby) so they grabbed it, but it's too heavy for a baby to lift and the legs are too fat for tiny hands to squeeze. So after a few pats and pokes my babies grew bored of it and moved on. We also have a smaller octopus (Lamaze Octivity Time)that is light and has lots of different stimuli that's been much more successful, and is one of my daughter's favorites",2
Lamaze Octotunes Musical Toy,"This was a Christmas gift the adults had great fun making music by reading the instructions, the toy smells like marshmellows and is very pleasing to the senses, the child like the noise ...",5
Lamaze Octotunes Musical Toy,Very good for a young one and he seemed facinated with it. I liked it and so did his parents.,5
Lamaze Buzz the Bug Play &amp; Grow,"Product is very colorful.  But, because it is larger than most toys that hang from gyms or car seat handles it dangles oddly. This is mostly becaust (as you see from picture) hook is on one of the legs instead of the middle of the body.  So, I have yet to find a place to dangle it where it wasn't laying in my childs lap or in his face. Also, compared to the other Lamaza toys like this, it has less features (noise, crinkle, and activites that entertain). You would be much better of with the giraffe or peacock.",4
Lamaze Buzz the Bug Play &amp; Grow,"My baby started playing with this bug since about 1.5-2 months and loved it after that, discovering more new interesting things about it. The rings are good as teethers, multiple sound options are interesting for the baby and not too loud, overall the toy is soft, pleasant to touch and easy to handle, not to mention the attractive bright colors.",5
Lamaze Buzz the Bug Play &amp; Grow,My son loves this toy.  It goes everywhere with us.  Perfect introduction to different textures and colors.,5
Lamaze Buzz the Bug Play &amp; Grow,Got this as a gift for the baby before the birth.  Still this is a favorite toy that puts smile on baby's face.  Makes for interesting time when played with.,5
Lamaze Octivity Time,"This always calms our son down. He loves playing with it. Although,it does overwhelm him at times. Personally, I would like it more if the legs weren't so overstuffed (he tries SO hard too chew on them but they're too thick) then it would be perfect.",4
Lamaze Octivity Time,"I am so happy that I bought my baby girl the octivity time octopus! 1st off its HUGE, super CUTE, plush with many different textures & toy attachments, LOVE her taggies mohawk, big happy smile on its face and my fave is the hella cute squeak it makes when you squeeze her head!!! Its perfect for my little one who is only 10 weeks old, I prop it on her lap and she smiles as she kicks it & is having so much fun touching the different arms!",5
Lamaze Octivity Time,"My infant LOVES Octivity Time.  He really has no idea what to do with him yet, but he loves reaching for him and looking at him in his swing.",5
Lamaze Octivity Time,"When my son was 7 months old, he really liked to play with this toy. It was great for him to learn to grab and hold on to things and to explore different textures. At 17 months, he'll still play with it sometimes but not like when he was younger. It is big enough that it can sit on their belly (in a bouncy chair) or on their lap/floor in front of them and be easy for them to grasp at it and manipulate it but not so big it engulfs them. A good toy especially for the second half of the first year!",4
Lamaze Octivity Time,"I saw another child with this toy and was so taken by it that I ordered three for gifts.  It is as cute as can be and offers sensory stimulation, sight, sound and touch.",5
Lamaze Octivity Time,"My daughter's daycare had this Octivity Time and they attached it to their bouncer chairs, so the child would have something to manipulate while sitting...My daughter LOVED this toy...You can also attached it to infant carriers/strollers/etc.  There are a numerous activities for the child to play with and the colors and sounds make this engaging for a young infant.  I have just gifted one of these to one of my daughter's caregivers that is pregnant.  High recommend!!!!",5
Lamaze Octivity Time,Bought this for my 5 month old nephew and he was SUPER engaged playing with it.  Was glad to see that he was entertained with each &#34;arm&#34; as if it were a new toy when he looked at each one.  Super cute!,5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"Lamaze toys are colorful, textured, sound and feel interesting for a baby.  I think this toy will work with a baby to toddler.  This toy is easy for the baby to hold.  The only thing it is lacking is a ring to attach it to the stroller or playpen, or car seat.",4
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"I really liked the toy, my daughter is loving this beautiful centipede. Very well finished, a product of excellent quality.delivery delay, but worth it.",5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,My son absolutely adores this it has a little musical thing in the nose so when you squeeze it it plays a song and all the different colors have different textures. Super cute really good quality material,5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"I normally can't get enough of Lamaze toys.  They are usually wonderful baby and toddler toys, but this particular one disappointed me slightly.  First of all, the music is very quiet and electronic sounding.  It sounds like the music you might get from a cheap toy at the dollar store.  There is also no way to replace the battery, so when it stops it's done for good.  The textures and rattles are great, but other toys have these as well.  I would recommend a different Lamaze toy.",2
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"He never gets into playing with this, I think because it is not so easy to grab and lift. He prefers the Lamaze puppy, which has more grabbable parts and is smaller so he can lift it to his mouth.Lamaze Pupsqueak",3
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"My boy loved it from the first time he saw it. He loves the sound from its head, the different textures of its body's materials, and the bells embedded inside. He also uses it as a mini bolster. Such a great purchase I would say.",4
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"I bought this for my 8 month old as an Easter present and he loves it. I was surprised at the size of the toy, as it's much bigger that I thought it would be, which I love! Each section of the worm does something different so it stimulates your child's senses. This would be a great toy from 3 months to 2 years.",5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"An interesting toy, which gives joy to my girls. They suck with their eyes when they see it. It can switch easily from crying to laughing. I recommend it to newborns +!![...]",5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,This musical inchworm is excellent for my newborn baby.  I was looking for developemental toys that have different texture and lots of different colors and this is perfect.  I also purchased the Puppytunes and Jacque the Peacock.  I love all the Lamaze products.,5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"This is a great toy...interesting patterns, cute little song, perfect green legs for little hands to grab, squeaks and jingles! Just don't measure baby's length with it.  It is not accurate unless you really stretch it out.",5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,If this plays &#34;If you're happy and you know it clap your hands&#34; then my name is &#34;The Artist formally known as Prince&#34;.... Toy seems ok but not as well made as I expected and the song it plays is some Chinese tune that I don't recognize....,1
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"We took this inchworm to the hospital and had it in baby's bassinet.  We have lots of photos of baby with this toy, and it's fun to see baby outgrow the toy.  Our baby was 21"" when born, so I imagine that it would be a lot more meaningful if you had a smaller baby to scale with the toy over the next few months of growth.The musical part is a button inside the inchworm's nose, lasts about 8 measures.  There are also crinkly segments, a bell, a squeaker.  The external fabrics are also different depending on which segment--velvety, soft, satin, and bumpy.",5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"This inchworm is bright, fun, and my daughter loves it. It makes all sorts of different sounds, and the ""head"" plays music, which cracks her up.  You can also measure your little one with the underside...my baby is bigger than the inchworm now, but it was fun to see her growth with this toy.  Lamaze toys are the best.",5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"Kinda big for a baby.  The inch line is useless... really, it's for a baby!  Thought it would be great, but doesn't get played with much.",3
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"BUYER BEWARE! If you want a geniune LaMaze inchworm this is -NOT- the real thing. Even the Lamaze tag is upside down and smaller than what the real thing comes with. The feet are green rather than brown. The colors on the segments don't match up. The stitching is terrible and the material is cheap. The music unit in the nose is oversized, protrudes and doesn't play the song the real unit plays (the real unit should play If &#34;You're Happy And You Know It&#34;).. Here's where things get fun:We identified the song this unit plays:It's Jennifer Lopez's &#34;On The Floor&#34; Ft. Pitbull. from 2011.Which was stolen. The sample from &#34;On The Floor&#34; actually originated from an Indian song called &#34;Soch Na Kya&#34; from the 1990 Indian movie &#34;Ghayal&#34;.... which was stolen from a famous French Brazilian song form 1989 called &#34;Lambada&#34; by the group Kaoma.... which was also stolen. The melody from &#34;Lambada&#34; was taken from a 1986 Portuguese song called &#34;Chorando Se Foi&#34; by Marcia Ferreira.... ... which was also stolen. The melody from &#34;Chorando Se Foi&#34; was taken directly from the original:&#34;Lloranda se fue&#34; by Bolivian band Los Kharkas in 1981.You've really outdone yourself this time, China. Honestly I'm not even mad. I'm actually impressed.Seriously though I'd really love to get my money back and have this listing more clearly state that this is NOT in-fact a genuine LaMaze product.",1
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"Just got this toy for my 4 month old and she loves it! All the different sounds, colors and textures really keep her attention. The head does play a musical tune but it's not if you're happy and you know. Not exactly sure what the song is but she still enjoys it.",5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,My nephews first Christmas was a hit with this gift he still loves it. Will continue to order other things,5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"This is a really cute and well made item.  Bright, colourful and makes noise.  The tune is short enough that it isn't totally irritating.  The measurement side is irrevelant for us as our son was longer than the inchworm at 8 weeks (Hes going to be very tall!) It is a shame that it doesn't have a long clip or hook so that it can be clipped to a pushchair(Stroller) and not fall on to the floor. Good value for money.",5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"I considered this toy for my 9 1/2 month old granddaughter after reading other reviews about it first.I am so glad that I made this purchase as she enjoys playing with. Her 7 yr old sister will wiggle it around for,and help her to push on the different areas to hear the music, sounds, etc... and she giggles the whole timethey play together.",5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,my little baby loves this thing! perfect for any newborn up through many months old.  great for entertaining your little ones!,5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,So cute and my 4 month old granddaughter loves all the crinkly noises and textures. Its a fun Inchworm for interacting with the baby shes enthralled with it. Very happy with the purchase,5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"This isn't my son's favorite toy, but he does enjoy chewing on it regardless of that fact. I machine wash it and it still plays music. We also have the giraffe, he's a big hit!",5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"This was a Christmas gift for my daughter who was just a few days shy of 6 mths when she received it for Christmas. Now, Jan 8th, she still hasn't played with it & we offer it to her during floor time almost daily. It's cute & well made, but my little girl just isn't interested in it. Maybe better for a younger baby? Right now all my daughter wants to do is chew on small teething toys that fit in her little hand.",2
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,This product is good quality and interesting to me as an adult.  My 6 month old doesn't seem to find it interesting at all.  We've had it for a couple of months now and she hasn't really gotten excited for it like most of her other toys.  I think part of the problem is that it's too big and she can't manuever it around.  She may like it better as she gets older.  I think I would recommend other toys before this one.,3
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"Love the inchworm! Bought for my son, and he played with it constantly. Now that he is older, my daughter has it, and she just loves all the crinkly parts :)",5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"We loved this toy when we got it.  Great addition to our lamaze developmental toy collection.  It squeaks, crinkles and plays music.",5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,Lamaze products are amazing because they are so cute and colorful. The problem? They all seem to do the same thing.  We received this as a gift and while its cute and cuddly its not a favorite.  Like another person posted it can nicely be used to prop a child up for tummy time...and could be cute to take pictures of next to.  But...we got two inchworms...and the other one we got the pieces actually come apart so you can connect the inchworm together & it sings.  And while connecting the pieces is harder for a newborn to do (ok impossible!) it definitely grows with the child!  My 2.5 year old is entertained by it and allows the two kids to play together...so...nix this worm and go look for the other one!,3
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"It's colorful, multi textured, light enough for baby to handle and a plastic ring to hang it or attachet to the arm of a carrage once it's born!",4
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,This toy it's not the original. looks cheap and plays the &#34;lambada&#34;it's not an appropriate song for a baby. =(,2
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,MY DAUGHTER LOVES THIS WORM AND PLAYS WITH IT ALL THE TIME. I T WAS WORTH EVERY PENNY; GET ONE!,5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"Made the mistake of getting the 'cheap' one without checking the full seller details. It's from China and definitely a knock off. We got the Rhianna song version, like some other reviewers. It arrived with no packaging, just in a bubble envelope. There is a ruler fabric painted on the belly and the paint is poor quality. The music module in the head is sewn between the filler and the outside fabric, with the outline clearly visible from the outside, as well as being a hard point on an otherwise soft toy. Every section with a rattle or bell is sewn this way.It took about 2 seconds after opening to realize we didn't get what we expected because the overall feel of the toy is definitely not Lamaze standards. It's now our most expensive dog toy.",1
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"Scored this for $10 on ebay and had to write about it... Especially after reading the other reviews on it... Especially the negative ones~This is a beautifully created toy for baby! Gorgeous colors... Crunchy, squeaky, rattle that also plays music at a nice volume.Don't hesitate~ Get one but save your dollars and go to ebay ;)",5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"My seven month old loves this toy.  Each of the sections of the caterpillar do something different - some crinkle, some rattle, the nose has a musical tune that plays when you squeeze it.  They also are all different colors and textures, and are very stimulating for a baby.",4
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"I have been buying this Inchworm for friends and family babies for over 15 years, and most of the kids STILL have them!  For some reason, these are very popular and become a favorite, beloved toy well after infancy. The best gift for the price anywhere!",5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"I bought this toy for my daughter who hasn't arrived yet so I don't know what her opinion of it will be.  I was a bit disappointed because I thought each section of the worm would have a different sound and/or texture.  The textures are all the same and two of the sections crinkle when you squeeze them and two of the sections rattle...that's it! I was hoping that there would be a squeek and something scratchy, etc. but we will see! Other than that though it is very well constructed and the colours and very nice and bold.",3
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"My 15 month old daughter has absolutely no interest in this toy. We bought this for her when she was around 6 months old or so and she has never played with it. It doesn't do anything. I think there is one spot that will play a little bit of music when you squeeze it, but that's about it. Save your money.",1
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"He has been entertained and intrigued with the toy from 5 months to 15 months. Of course, he plays with it differently (throwing it around and such) but it keeps him entertained and is a good investment as far as I'm concerned.",5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,I saw this product in a store and loved the different textures and feels when you squeezed the different parts of the worm. underneath the worm is a ruler with inches and centimeters under it. I also loved that the music was quiet and yet not to loud to be heard all over the house.,5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"I've had this toy for about a month so far and I use it almost every day. When I put my daughter on her back to play, I place this enchanting snake beside her and she likes to mouth at its face! The other day she bit its mouth! She's 3 and a half months; hopefully she'll pay more attention to it as she grows older. I love the rattles and the different colors and textures and hopefully she will too. It's bigger than I thought too which is great!",5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"My 6 month old wasn't interested in this toy at all. I think it's geared for much younger babies. I try to have her hold it or squeeze it every now and then, but other toys always get her attention over this one.",3
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"This is a great product. I wish I would have bought it sooner. The measuring side is a nice bonus to watch your child grow. Unlike other reviewers who felt the music was too low, I felt the volume of the music was fine because my child likes to hold the inchworm close. I also like that there is a segment on the inchworm that squeaks. I would highly recommend this. Also, it is easy to curl up and transport. If you have other Lamaze products, you may notice they use the same fabric swatches.",5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"We've twins and have had this toy since their births. One of the babies absolutely adores this toy. The other couldn't care less. It probably depends, like so many things, on the temperament of the baby in question. For instance, the baby who DOESN'T like the inchworm can't get enough ofLamaze Play and Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy-- specifically the black and white patterned side. They are both only ten weeks old after all.Some people have said that the music sounds like a hallmark card (or worse) and while that's perhaps true, it totally makes the toy worth it from birth onward. The baby who DOES like it wouldn't have it any other way. He could be mid meltdown and you just have to poke the inchworm's nose -- he'll stop everything to listen. He'll even stop when you sing the inchworm's song. With no other song does he do this. Magic!My only gripe with this toy is that it's very difficult for the baby to truly get a handle on it. Unlike Freddie the Firefly, it's hard to keep it near to be able to chew on the knotties. Also the squeaker section needs pressed VERY hard in order to get it to squeak. I doubt a baby would be able to manipulate it until perhaps they're approaching toddlerhood... but what do I know? Perhaps Lamaze was trying to make it be a toy that could fit a lot of ages rather than just one tiny spread. I hope he doesn't get tired of it by then.",4
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,I like the different textures for my 3 month old to touch.Dislike the music - it's very cheap sounder. I prefer it not to make noise than what's on it.Overall a nice buy!,3
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,The toy is quite long and is a bit difficult for my 5 month old to move around since it seems like she can't get a good grasp with one hand. She can move it around if she can get a hold of the little cloth legs,4
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,This item is very cute. It has lots of colors and textures- perfect for a baby. I think my grandson will really like it.,5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,Baby loves it. Especially the two crinkle sections and the rattle. He chews the knotted legs too. It's entertaining for him.,5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,This is so far the favorite toy of my 3 month old son. When he sees it he gets all excited. He can't do much more than to kick and cooo  yet but he does it a lot when the inchworm is in his view. I expect the toy to grow with him. Only draw back is the music is very very low you have to be really quiet to hear it.  I got this toy because it is orange and we realized that our baby loved orange things and we didn't make a mistake. He really loves it....,4
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,My twins really enjoy this worm. Every section is different and  makes crinkle sounds or beeps or rattles. The feet and antennas are great for teething and the music  is very soft and sweet. We have tons of Lamaze toys-they are they best.,5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,This toy was a good buy for my baby because it makes her laugh and smile just by hearing the &#34;happy and you know it&#34; song.,5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"I'm not too sure what the big deal is about this inch worm, but I'm not very impressed. The music is a high pitched annoying noise. It's NOT really music.",5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"It is a very colorful toy and it does make different noises but my son does not seem interested in it for now. Maybe when he will grow a bit more he will be able to play more with it, but as for now we are not using it.",4
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"My 6 month old grandson loves this toy, BUT... I had to sew one of the legs back on and reinforce the others after he played with it for only one day. This definitely presented a safety issue if not repaired. Also, the fabric on the underside and head is fuzzy and attracts dirt like a dust mop. It looked very dirty after a very  short time. I had to scrub it to get it looking clean again. The concept of the toy is great but the execution in construction is lacking.",3
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"The vibrant colors and the varied textures, materials are good visual stimuli. The length of toy is good, for pulling and rolling around.",5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,my gradson loves this he is 5 monthes old and I put it so he can kick it and loves the crinkle sound it makes when kicked.  love the bright colors.  I have  some other Lamaze toys and have liked all of them.,5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"I think this toy is very cute and colorful and that's about it. As others have said, it's pretty boring and the baby ends up mostly hugging it or mouthing it (but he mouths anything). Each worm segment has something inside, but the worm is so plush you have to press pretty hard.  He much prefers his other toys and i suspect this worm will soon become just a room decoration.  Oh, and the music is very tinny and ANNOYING-it's not loud but it's high pitched, which is the worst combination.",2
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"Bought this toy for my kid as my nephew really liked his. But it doesn't play the song &#34;if you are happy and you know it&#34;, instead it plays some cheesy Lambada song, which isn't very appropriate for kids. Amazon sent a replacement after we gave feedback, but the replacement still plays the same music.  Suggest Amazon change the description or fix the problem with the supplier.",1
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"I bought the inchworm for my niece as a Christmas gift. At the time, she was 1.5 months. She absolutely loved it and out of all the gifts she received, this was definitely the most safe. Now that her motor skills are improving at 4 months, she plays with it often. This is a wonderful item and is highly recommended for newborns and children under 1 year.",5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"My son didn't pay much attention to this toy when he was younger, but at around 10 months it started to catch his attention. He won't play with it on his own, but if we kind of chase him with it - he cracks up so much!",4
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,I didn't not buys this toy on Amazon I got it at babys r us .. It's a good toy . My son enjoyed it but beware parents the legs could poke your babys eyes.. It did to my son so I had to cut the legs off:(,2
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"Babies love music and this worm is so cute and much larger than I thought, which is a good thing!!",5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"I got this delivered and found out that the the toy doesn't play any music at all. I tried looking for a way to find an opening but couldn't find any(May be I am missing something simple). I did buy it from ""Danny's Dealz"" so not sure if they had these laying around for a long time. I have contacted the seller and waiting for the response. I will edit my reivew once I see the response.I am keeping it at 3 stars because my 2.5 mth old daughter did like the toy specially the tongue sticking out from the mouth of the inchworm, if the music also played I would give it 5 stars. As far as the the seller, I will wait before I leave them feed back.Update:I updated my rating to 5 stars. Danny' Dealz responded to my email and sent me another one right away along with a prepaid envelope to send the first one back. I was glad that Danny's Dealz kept up the amazon standard while dealing with customers.My daughter seems to like Lamaze toys because they are so colorful(or so I think, I don't think she can see colors yet) I just with they allowed a way change the batteries in this one.",5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,My 2 month old already has a lot of fun with this toy. Each section has different feels and makes different sounds. This toy can also be used to measure a baby's height.,5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,We received this as a gift and my son couldn't love it more.  He started really focusing and holding it at about 9 weeks.  Each section has a different tactile experience and bending the head just right makes music.  Perfect car seat companion.,5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"This toy is colorful, plays a song and is easy to hold on to. It has a lot of crinkly parts and different textures.",5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"My daughter loves this but even at 8 months she still has trouble finding the button on the nose to make the music play because it just hidden by the fabric with no indicator. Other than that, she still likes to play it with because of all the colors, sounds and textures: it rattles, makes scrunch noises and has fuzzy fabric. For some reason she really likes the loop at the end but she tends to play with the tags on things so maybe that's why.",4
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"Our daughter loves the toy, but the song it plays is most definitely NOT ""If you're happy and you know it clap your hands."" Instead it's ""Llorando se Fue"", which most people know better for having been sampled in Jennifer Lopez's song ""On the floor"". Given that the manufacturers programmed in the original song rather than the JLo version it's marginally more age-appropriate, I suppose.Youtube link to the original: [...]",3
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"Liked the colors, nice & bright; cute music, not too loud it seemed - heard through packaging though. It's cute",4
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"My young daughter loves this toy, and now that she's learning to crawl, she drags it with her all the time. The material is a bit cheap, and the stuffing has begun to come out at the stitching. Also, the song that plays when you press the button is a little creepy. It's not a song in the public domain that I recognize. Other than creepy song worm head with stuffing brains falling out, yeah it's great! :|",4
Lamaze Spin &amp; Explore Garden Gym,"my kid hated tummy time so i got this.  he hates this even more.  my friends' kid, who likes tummy time hates it also.",1
Lamaze Spin &amp; Explore Garden Gym,"On time from when I ordered and love the product.  Easy to use, easy to wash and baby doesn't hate tummy time as much now.",5
Lamaze Spin &amp; Explore Garden Gym,Great product. I gave this as a gift and it was the biggest hit at the Baby Shower.,5
Lamaze Spin &amp; Explore Garden Gym,"My daughter has cerebral palsy and this toy has helped build her neck and back muscles quite a bit. She also seemed to have fun and it didn't seem like exercise to her at all. It did take some getting used to, but by about the 4th or 5th time, she was loving it.",5
Lamaze Spin &amp; Explore Garden Gym,"The usefulness of this product really depends on the baby.  My daughter HATED tummy time and this product made no difference.  I wouldn't pay full price for this again without trying it out first.  It's a great concept, but doesn't hold up in reality.  And it would only be useful for a month or two.  Maybe the mat would be fun later without the lady bug in the middle...",2
Lamaze Spin &amp; Explore Garden Gym,"My 4 month old daughter loves the spin and play garden. It's the perfect tummy time play mat!!! I just wish it had been around when my son was that little. He's 19 months old and plays with his sister with the attached toys. It's a must have for any new baby! It is well built and even stands up to my son's not so gentle touch. It stores easy when not in use, and is easy to clean. This is definately worth the money you pay for it. I just can't help but sing the praises of this wonderful toy!!!!",5
Lamaze Spin &amp; Explore Garden Gym,"It is a neat idea, but I don't think it is worth the price. Unless you find it on sale, it's not worth the money. It's just a piece of fabric with animals on it. You could make the same thing for much cheaper. Like I said, it is a cool toy, but for what you get, it's overpriced.",3
Lamaze Spin &amp; Explore Garden Gym,"If they made one of these things for adults, I'd get one!!  My daughter LOVES this thing.  It's got that crinkle-sounding paper that babies seem to love, and spins really easily. The colors are really bright and everything is easily accessable for little arms and hands.  I have already told my pregnant friends that they need to get one of these!",5
Lamaze Spin &amp; Explore Garden Gym,"The first thing you'd think of when making something like this for infants/toddlers would be safety, right? Guess not.We laid this thing on a flat hardwood floor and our son couldn't get traction since the cloth slipped all over the floor. So we moved the thing onto a carpet. One of the first red flags that popped into my head when seeing this thing was that you just lay the spinner on top of the cloth; there's no anchor system for the apparatus like in other explore mat-systems where the hard plastic is anchored under the cloth.Well, the red flag was unfortunately justified. On a flat surface, our 4 month-old son still had the misfortune to tilt his body in a way that lifted the spinner up and it then came down on his fingers. Now, I want you to imagine the entirety of your body weight coming down with hard plastic edges on your fingers. Doesn't sound very forgiving pain-wise, does it? We didn't even know what was going on as we'd never heard him cry or scream like that before.Now we're sitting here with a screaming kid and wondering if we should take him to the doc since he goes back to screaming a minute after waking up.Sad thing is that I think he'd really be into this thing but if you can't bother to engineer a product that's marketed towards developing infants but doesn't prevent something like this happening to an infant, then you get 1 star from me. Yeah, it was also bad luck, but that's what preventative engineering is for.",1
Lamaze Spin &amp; Explore Garden Gym,"My little one has never been interested in tummy time.  I purchased this in hopes of making it a little more exciting for him and it worked!  He loves looking at himself in the mirror or listening to the crinkle of the leaves or wings when his hands move over them.  I know he's not meaning to just yet, but he's been able to move himself around and has been able to enjoy all the sections of this gym.I would highly recommend it for babies who are less than happy with tummy time!",5
Lamaze Spin &amp; Explore Garden Gym,"My daughter hated tummy time, she would struggle to prop up so she could see things, so I thought she might like this little gym. The mat is way too small, when she was on the spinner in the middle her head extended almost all the way out past the edge. There is also no way to strap a baby in, so you end up with a young infant dangling in the air off a piece of plastic. When she got tired she still flopped her head to the floor, only now her neck is resting on a plastic edge. The cover for the spinner is also just a piece of cloth, not much padding to it.Overall, good idea but bad in practice. If your baby is old enough to be safe/comfortable playing on it, then they are old enough not to need it.Very uncomfortable, and my daughter hated it.",2
Lamaze Celeste Play &amp; Grow,"This is my daughter's favorite toy. She will play with it for long periods of time. Her favorite part is the purple bee face, which she tends to chew. She is crawling now, and drags it around with her. Thank goodness I can wash and dry it!!",5
Lamaze Celeste Play &amp; Grow,"My son loved this toy as a baby. He still loves these type toys, he's almost 2 now, but this particular one is now in storage. This one was his favorite. He loved the sun on one side and moon on the other. He'd flip back-and-forth between the sides and look at them.",5
Lamaze Celeste Play &amp; Grow,Great gift for new mothers and baby girls.  My daugter loved her smily sunny face and we put it in her crib and stroller.  She has outgrown the toy but it has been passed on to our niece who loves it.  Toy has lasted more than 5 years so far and is easy to clean.,5
Lamaze Balancing Bug Stacker,"The rubbery antanne is wonderful to chew and they are very bright, with durable plastic. I can't forsee my child breaking them.The problem is with me.I oviously over loooked the part of them being ""magnetic"".Where is the fun in that?The magnets are so strong you can pick them up when all of them are connected!They will suffice untill I find other non-magnetic stackers.",3
Lamaze Balancing Bug Stacker,"I wish that they had more magnets on each one, so that the toys would stick together on sides also.  My littlest grandchildren could not stack all of them on top yet.  They would have enjoyed just that they stuck together all over.  Very easy to handle and chew, as suggested.",4
Lamaze Balancing Bug Stacker,"I bought this for my son when he was one, and now he is 3 and he still plays with them. There are 4 other children in my family the same age as my son, and all of them have always loved to stack these bugs up and knock them over. I just bought these as a gift for my best friend's daughter. You know it's a great toy when children love it for years.",5
Lamaze Balancing Bug Stacker,I bought these magnetic blocks when my baby was only 6 months old.  She tried to build with them and cracked up over knocking them over even then.  She is now 18 months old and gets great satisfaction from the fact that she can build them up (I can see it in her face).  I liked them so much I bought a second set so that she could build even higher.  (They only go about 9 tall before they sway and fall-but isn't that 1/2 the fun?),5
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,Friend loved them!,5
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,"I received this product in the mail today, I can't say that I am thrilled with how it arrived. The pieces were loose and in a plastic bag, they were not in any type of professional packaging and was concerned they were not new. I washed them in the wash before letting my daughter use them. Had I ordered these as a gift, I wouldn't have been able to give them out as they simply came in a regular zip lock style baggy. That is very disappointing as the product itself is cute and my daughter really likes them. We use them while she plays in her play gym and during tummy time they are helpful and she finds them enjoyable.",2
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,Our grandson loves these! He is so into his toes and responds to the noices these make and also the bright colors! He is 4 months old.,5
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,Wristlets stay on well and everything is adorable but the socks don't really stay on my baby's feet (even before he was crawling).,3
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,"Thought these rattles were super cute and colorful, but they just don't interest my son.  Hopefully he changes his mind!",3
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,My son loved these foot and wrist rattles. The colors are bright and have the black and white contrast. I also used pacifier clips to hang these from his bassinet so he could swat them around.,5
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,"Purchased for new GrandBaby and she loves them, they are a bit small for wrists but baby loves the socks when grabbing her feet! Good quality great price and super fast ship",5
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,"With our first child, I bought these so our baby could have some stimulation when he was young.  These are more entertainment for adults because the baby didn't really notice them because he had to wave his wrist directly in front of his eyes, which happens like once in a blue moon.  Then you get paranoid that the little animals will fall off and land in your kids mouth.",1
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,"The rattles are cute but doesn't really serve their function to ""rattle"". The sound is really low and you have to kind of shake quite hard in order for the rattle sound to be heard. It's hard for newborn to shake their hands/feet to make it sound hard enough to interest them. When I put it on my newborn she wasn't even aware that they're there. At 12 week, my daughter is starting to gain more control of her hands and feet and awareness so I'm going to give it a try again but the foot rattle no longer fits her. They should really make it a bit bigger.",3
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,"My baby loves these, especially the wrist ones. Shipping from Hong Kong takes awhile but once they got here it was great!",5
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,i ordered this for a christmas gift for a relative. sure the baby girl loved it. it was  very cute.,5
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,"These are very cute, but they don't make enough noise to be effective. My daughter hardly pays attention to them because you can barely hear the rattle.",2
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,"I bought these for my 2 month old. They are cute on her arms but right now, she doesn't really notice them.I think as she gets older, she may look at them a little more and chew on them some. They are cute and colorfull and for the price, nice toys to get your baby to start looking at some things around them.",4
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,my bb is 18 weeks and the velcro on the wrist band can just manage to meet at both ends on her wrist. Its not gonna be good for bigger babies. I hope my bb will enjoy touching her feet!,3
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,"Just like the title - A little too expensive for what you get. First of all, only one of the arm bands actually makes noise. The other doesn't have a bell, or at least the one I received didn't. Second, the socks are HUGE! I bought them for my 3 month old who has big feet as it is and these just fall off of her. I am a bit disappointed and would probably return but I threw away the box when I first got them because I did not think I'd end up wanting to return them. If they were cheaper I wouldn't mind so much.",3
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,"My daughter began noticing these when she was 5 weeks old.  We would show them to her when we would change her diaper, but not put them on her.By 6 weeks old she was showing a definite interest in the wrist bee toy by smiling at it.  We began calling it Mr. Bee, and we placed it on her wrist whenever she was in her bouncer or in her BebePod.  At eight weeks old, she began babbling and cooing to Mr. Bee whenever she wasn't interacting with us.My daughter is now 17 weeks old, and Mr. Bee is still her best friend.  She really enjoys visiting with Ms. Ladybug and Mr. Dragonfly, too.  We don't have them all visit at once- my daughter is happiest with one-on-one interaction with each of them.I love that she can have a little ""friend"" velcroed to her when we go out- it can't get dropped, and is small enough to tag along.*UPDATE*I bought a new set of bugs for my new baby boy, and he adores them!  At four months old, his favorite is Mr. Dragonfly.  My daughter- now two- still loves these little toys!",5
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,My 4 month old grandson loves these little critters. He waves his hands around in front of his face. His 2 1/2 year old brother loves putting them on too and plays with his little brother with them while they settle down for a nap. Great purchase,5
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,"My son just gave me my 18th grandbaby a couple of months ago. These were not available anywhere in my town. I got this for a Christmas present. It was just wonderful. On time delivery and all my gifts I purchased from Amazon were in perfect condition. I can depend on Amazon for accurate information before the purchase and service after the sale, unlike other online sales companies. Even when the delivery is from another vendor, I can rest assured the product is as advertised and will be on time and perfect. I appreciate that immensely as I don't have a car and can't get out to shop unless one of my kids comes to take me. This was just what the doctor ordered for little Kristian!! And I didn't have to leave the farm!!",5
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,I ordered these for my grandson.  They are so cute.  He is going to love grabbing for them.  They were delivered as shown and are just right.,5
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,These are absolutely adorable.  The wrist rattles attach easily with velco and the others are cute socks.  The rattling part could be a bit louder but my granddaughter loves to look at them while she wears them. A good product especially for babies before they can easily hold their own rattling toys.,5
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,"I bought this for my son when he is 3 months old. The wrist bands barely fit, and the socks are way too small. Plus, the socks are low quality, not elastic, not even foot-shaped. The bugs are cute though. I think I will just use the bugs as hand-held rattles.",3
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,My daughter is small for her age and these didn't fit once she was old enough to take interest in them. Now they are just part of her toy collection. She likes the bugs but they don't go on her feet and they barely go around her wrists but they don't stay on.,3
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,"I love the concept of these.... it's just that 1. I wish the rattles were a little louder and 2. the socks aren't that stretchy and they are kind of small on my 3 mo. old's feet. I think he'll grow out of them this month. I don't know... i just think with some minor improvements they could be a much better quality item. Like the little antlers on the bugs are kind of poky. I like them, but i don't love them. I think the idea of the rattles are 5 stars but the execution is only a 3... hence the four stars above :)",4
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,"These are so cute, but my baby's arms were too big by the time I got these.  Love the idea, will definitely save for second child.",4
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,"We have had ours for several months now (bought when she was 3 mths, she is now 7 mths.). Our baby still plays with them even though I don't put the rattles on her anymore. She loved kicking off the socks. Which was fun to watch. It's all great exercise for baby. I have even used one of the wrist rattles in her car seat. I attached it to the strap so that she had something to play with because she isn't able to really keep a good grip on toys, yet. The socks are really great for her because they have more material for her little hands to grip. ***Here are the toys measurements (taken with seamstress tape): Wrist Rattles: 5 and 5/8 inches, Sock Rattles: 6 inches.*** These toys have machine washed well in a delicate cycle and air dry. These rattles are adorable and definitely worth buying. They would make a great baby shower/welcome baby gift.",5
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,Bought these for my daughter as a stocking stuffer. Not many options for a 1 month old!She like the wrist rattles but the foot rattles don't stay on and they don't make enough noise. I thought they'd encourage her to touch her feet but she ended up touching her feet more when they were off.,2
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,"My son is 5 months old and simply LOVES these rattles. Just a tip, wear the socks OVER TOP of their normal socks/jumpers to help them stay on better. My little guy always plays with his feet when he sits in his bumbo seat which is what prompted me to purchase these. The wrist rattles are a treat and I almost wish they'd sell a wrist rattle ""teether"" because he certainly likes to nibble at the crinkle fabric. The fabric patterns are alluring and eye catching for baby and the rattle is loud enough to hold attention but subtle enough to not be obnoxious.With a few girlfriends expecting babies very soon, I just found a new favorite staple to toss in their baby gift baskets.",5
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,I bought these for my newborn twins for a Christmas present since they were only 8 weeks old at Christmas. They love them and are now 6 mos. old and play with them all the time! My Mother-in-Law bought some to have at her house for them to play with too! Definately a great buy!,5
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,The item I received does not look exactly like this one pictured. The socks on the feet have black/white stripes. I am very pleased with the black/wipe stripes as it is what catches our 3-month old's interest! He loves to chew on the wings of the butterfly and hear the crinkling noises. Overall I am very pleased with this item.,5
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,"I bought these for my daughter because she found her feet, and I figured since she was always playing with them I would get her something to put on her feet to play with. I put them on her feet and she loves them. It funny because now she talks to her feet.",5
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,I ordered these as a gift for my grandson. My daughter said he loved them and they really stayed on his feet while he played with them. I'm super happy. They were a great gift.,5
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,These toys are great for our two month old baby boy. He can't yet grasp a toy on his own so having it attached is good.  He loves them.,5
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,"These came on time, but my daughter was so tiny they wouldnt stay on. Well save them for the next baby & hope to get better use out of them",5
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,"Fun rattle for our little one. Our baby girl really latched onto these wrist and baby rattles. We didn't think it would be this fast, but she loved them and every time we put them on. We have had them for 3 kids now and they are cute and durable!",5
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,"I was so excited to get these for my granddaughter, but she (and I) was less than impressed.  The sounds are very muted and not too exciting for either of us.  They do not keep her attention for long :(",3
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,"it was part of a gift for a baby shower. the item was cute, but it had NO packaging! it was in a small plastic zip lock bag. could have been used for all I know. very disappointed",3
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,"The wrists rattles were OK.....my son was never distracted by them. I feel like the rattles were too soft. The foot finders just suck. They never fitted him ( I bought them when he was 2 months, he's now 6 months and they still fall off easily).I don't think they help your little one to find their foot any faster. My son did just fine finding them in the bath tub first.",3
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,When you think of a rattle you think of that annoying noise...right? Well you are not gonna hear that here. As it is a great product it should have been put together better. The foot &#34;rattle&#34; kept falling off and he got really bored of this product after 2 days. There must be something better then these.,2
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,The foot set did not stay on.  My infant did not really enjoy the wrist rattles either.  Don't spend money on this product,2
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,"The wrist bands were small when he was 3 months old.  The socks did fit and he did enjoy those, but now he just pulls them off and uses them as a hand rattle, since there is no elastic or anything to keep them on his feet.  My older niece is 4 and amuses him by using them as sock puppets, but they are were never completely used as intended.  The bugs are cute and he loves the sound the wings on the butterfly make.",3
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,"The color of the toy I received is totally different from the picture, not lovely at all. I hate the color. Besides, the quality is also not so good, looks very cheap.",1
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,I bought these to keep my daughter entertained in her car seat. She absolutely loves these rattles. She laughs and talks to them. This has been one of the best purchases I have made.,5
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,This was a Christmas gift. It came as advertised. Baby used it and was happy with it. It was okay.,4
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,"4 1/2 month old loves these....only wish the socks would stay on better.  She kicks them off quite easily.  Otherwise, very bright and engaging for baby.  She loves staring at the bright colors and grabbing them, too.",4
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,They were cute but the rattle wasn't load at all. I would not buy these again bc I don't think my daughter even notices them since they don't make much noise,2
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,I bought these for my 3 month old granddaughter. They learn to find hands and feet.Pretty neat I guess I would have to recommend it.,4
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,My little guy discovered his feet with these. Definitely a ""why didn't I think of that"" item that everyone should have. Love the Lamaze line!,5
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,"My 3 month old is just starting to discover her hands and feet and so I thought these would be perfect.  She loves the bright colors and sounds they make.  She likes the foot finders better than the wrist rattle, at least for now.  The only problem I have is the foot finders are a little big and easily fall off when she really gets moving, but it hasn't been too much of a problem to just put them back on her and once her feet grow a little more I'm sure it won't be a problem at all.",4
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,My baby girl loves her new toys and it makes play time so much more interesting for her! I couldn't have made a better selection! Can't wait for her to ""find"" her feet!!!,5
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,"These looked adorable and like they were a great idea.  However, neither of my babies expressed any interest in them as infants.  They either ignored them or cried until I took them off.  They rediscovered them when they were a little over a year old and wanted to wear them then.  I have tiny twins (who wore 6mo clothing on their 1st birthday) so they still barely fit and my kids did have fun with them for a few months.  But if they had been any closer to average size they would never have used them.",2
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,This is what you buy for the baby who has everything.  My cousin recommended them to me..........says she buys them for every baby shower she goes to. :),5
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,"I thought this would be a very short term item -- only for a tiny baby. However, my grandson still liked his bugs and found they fit in his pocket or cup long past the time that the socks fit.",5
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,I'm a big fan of Lamaze but I was a little disappointed with this item. The little bugs are really cute and my 4 month old loves to look at them and play with them. Shipping was fast. My issue is that the rattles aren't loud enough to draw the attention of my baby.,3
Lamaze Patty the Panda,"The squeaker in this colorful toy never fails to produce a grin! She provides plenty of stimulation for a young baby as well as older with her contrasting predominately black and white color scheme. As my daughter has begun to teethe on everything she has derived a lot of satisfaction from chewing on Patty's ring with spinning beads. She's easy enough to surface wash with a mildly soaped up warm cloth. If she gets a bit linty a lint roller cleans her up nicely. The flowers that she holds are texture filled and seem to be sewn in very well so I'm not too worried about them detaching and becoming a possible choking hazard. Overall, my kiddo and I are pretty satisfied with Patty.",4
Lamaze Patty the Panda,"I bought this as a clearance item at our local baby store - best [...] I ever spent!  This was my daughter's first toy, and she has literally loved it since birth.  The eyes completely mesmerized her as a newborn.  As she has grown older, different aspects of the panda seem to come alive.  She teethes on the rings, and now that she's working on her fine motor skills, she fingers the flowers for ages.  This has always been a great toy to distract my daughter at the changing table or in the car.",5
Lamaze Patty the Panda,"I bought this for my daughter for Christmas, she was two months old at the time. She grabbed at it right away and wouldn't let go! It is still a big favorite!",5
Lamaze Patty the Panda,"My son doesn't actually play with this yet as it's hung from the handle of his stroller bassinet for walks, but he loves the high contrasting colors and stares at it for a long time.",5
Lamaze Dream Screen,"This was a gift.  We hated it from day one.  The music was obnoxiously loud with no volume control (we eventually covered the dual speakers with stickers to mute the music) and the motor is almost loud enough to drown out the music.  The screen seemingly stalls and jumps (which you hear) as it rotates.  We have a thin railed crib from Ikea that we could barely attach this too, and the straps are super hard to get at.  I would've also liked to have been able to dim the lights.  This was super bulky and just awful all the way around.  The only reason we didn't return it was so that we didn't offend the giver.",1
Lamaze Dream Screen,The battery is a big bulky thing that connects to the screen through the bars and with any amount of tugging on the screen the battery falls right off onto the floor. The screen also shakes and doesnt run smoothly. Not at all the quality I was expecting.,3
Lamaze Dream Screen,"This is an excellent way to keep your baby entertain, the screen has bright colors, I personally have an mp3 player hooked up to it, and my son listens to baby einstein as he stares @ the screen",5
Lamaze Dream Screen,"My son absolutely loves this thing.  I do have to say there is one down side to this.  If you have a sleigh crib with the back that curves not the sides.  You have to put this on the side where you let your bar up and down.  Not only does it look tacky but it's not functional there.  Also, sometimes you have to tap it a little hard to get it to turn on again (with new batteries).  But my son loves to watch this so I would have to say all in all it's worth the money.",5
Lamaze Dream Screen,"I LOVED this when I saw it online (and loved the idea you can connect an MP3 player to it, although we dont have one as yet) and quickly ordered it online and was really excited when it arrived.  That was UNTIL I installed it and turned it on ready to take my wee one into dreamland. OMG he nearly jumped out of his skin!  The volume on it is WAY too loud for its intention, to help soothe to sleep.  I have many different toys for a similar purpose, the best of which have volume control or at least two different volumes.  I did manage to put some invisible tape over the speaker which did help but shouldnt have had to!  Very bad design fault on an awesome product, from one of my fav brands. Still giving it four stars tho because it is awesome with the volume made more acceptable for baby to fall asleep too!",4
Lamaze Stack &amp; Spin Rings,I was disapointed by the annoying motor noise this toy makes when my 10 month old holds onto the center and rings while spinning.  The music and spinning cycle are not very long and not quite as fun as I thought it would be based on the other reviews.,3
Lamaze Stack &amp; Spin Rings,"My 5 month old loves this toy, it is easy for her to grab the rings with their ribbon tabs and she loves the music and motion when it spins.  Highly recommend!!  Will be giving as gifts for friends soon...",5
Lamaze Stack &amp; Spin Rings,"These are so adorable, my new little granddaughter loves them they are so soft and cuddly she loves them a lot!",5
Lamaze Stack &amp; Spin Rings,"This is a great toy for young toddlers, lot's of fun, and very stimulating.  A little over priced, but still worth it.",5
Lamaze 2-in-1 Traveling Guppy,"I attached this to my 2 month-old's crib and at first she stared at it alot, then she started swiping at it, eventually she learned to crinkle the tail, hold the littel tabs, later, learned to grab the baby fish. She also enjoyed flipping it over to the back. Now she is learning to spin the ball--it is such a low-tech toy, but has given her  a  LOT of enjoyment from about two months and including now at 8 months. We haven't used it in the car yet, now that her legs are longer we might try it, but it has been great as a crib toy and now a floor toy.",5
Lamaze Chime Garden,"My mother-in-law found this at a resale store and got it for my 4 month old because she loves toys with flashing lights. She was enthralled with it from the first minute. We set it on it's side in front of her when she's on her tummy so she can watch the lights, and she reaches out to touch the flowers. She loves the faces and ""talks"" to them. I like that the petals of the flowers are different textures, it adds a sensory experience, and the music is cute and soft and not annoying. I think she will have even more fun with it when she can press the flowers themselves and use the chiming feature, but even now she loves it.",5
Lamaze Chime Garden,"Only had this for a few days but baby, mom and dad are pleased with it so far. The colors/lights are more impressive at night or in a low light room. I like the music options.  I got a ""good job Grandma"" from my DIL.  She and my son are both teachers.....no pressure there!  A nice toy overall with music, visual stimulus and fine motor skills rewards.",5
Lamaze Chime Garden,"I bought this toy for my daughter five years ago and just recently bought a second one for my baby girl.  The music is lovely and easy to listen to.  The kids love the lights, various textures and music.  The newer version of this toy looks nice, but it doesn't light up.  Probably the best sounding toy I've come across in five years.",5
Lamaze Chime Garden,"I am a big fan of Lamaze toys and this one doesn't disappoint.  Baby enjoys the colors, textures, pleasing chime sounds and light show from the product.  I love the volume control switch on this product.  Allows you to turn it off, low volume or high volume.  Nice product.",5
Lamaze Chime Garden,"This was given to my daughter as a gift when she was just 3 months old. She is now 7 months old and is still in love with this toy. She absolutely loves it. When she first received it, we would sit it in front of her and play the music for her (music plays when you push the flowers) and her eyes would get super wide and she'd reach out for it. Now that she is older, she plays it on her own and is still just as much in love with it. Sadly the batteries have died and the screw is stuck. That's the only thing I do not like about this toy. The screw for the batteries is really REALLY deep into the plastic. So when we tried to unscrew it, it got halfway out and got stuck. It seems that the screw is stripped so it won't budge :o( I might have to get another one of these for her just because she loves it so much. I highly recommend it!",5
Lamaze Chime Garden,"My 12 month old son is blind and received this for his first birthday from an aunt.  It is an excellent sensory toy.  The music is soft and pleasant.  There are 3 different modes of sounds.  Some flowers have squishy soft petals, others have fluttery ribbon petals.  It stays flat on the ground for him.  It barely takes a tap on top of the flower to get it singing.  It also lights up.  I love this toy and would recommend it for younger babies than my son probably, even though it's perfect for him and the stage he's in, I'd say this is best for 6-12 months.",5
Lamaze Chime Garden,"We have this since our lil girl was 5 months old. She is 10 now - she loved it then and still loves it. Agreed that there are only three music options to select from, but it never bores her. The good part is the ascending order of music - Level 3 is the longest, level 1, just one tone. The colors are vibrant, she loves to eat on the flowers and even the leaf! It is a fun carry along anytime! I have loved Lamaze products so far and this seems to be the best.",5
Lamaze Chime Garden,"Bought it for my 5 months old and he loves it -- both touching the flowers for the music, and chewing on and touching the leaves! Would recommend it for babies that can sit (was not so great before my son could sit)",5
Lamaze Tucker Play &amp; Grow,"I love all of the Lamaze toys because my son would play with them when he was really young (3 - 4 monts). Although he likes the puppy dog one best, this is a close second.",5
Lamaze Tucker Play &amp; Grow,"Got this turtle (and the Lamaze Freddie the Firefly) for my two month old granddaughter.  My wife and i watched her get used to it and then love it.  She touches it, smiles at it, and it is obvious the little turtle delights her!!  Great choice for a small baby!Kris",5
Lamaze Tucker Play &amp; Grow,"What a great little toy!  Besides being cute, it holds up through many children playing with it.  I gave this to my first grandchild, then it was handed down to the next one, and then the next one, and now is in the hands of the fourth baby!  The mirror is a little scratched, but it is okay.  The fabric still looks new.  You can't go wrong with this little toy as a gift!  Now that I have two new grandchildren in other families, I need to buy two more!",5
Playtex Embrace Double Automatic Breastpump,"I am a breastfeeding and working mom, with a nine month old. I have realy put this pump to work! I have used a medela and this pump is much better for several reasons.The first is it is much more comfortable than a medla. The second is you can pump directly into your bottles vs pumping into a seperate container and then pouring your milk into a bottle. The third is it is much quieter than a medela.I could not ask for any more in a pump!",5
Playtex Embrace Double Automatic Breastpump,"My fist child I used the hospital Medela and quit breast feeding within 3 weeks because it was just uncomfortable, not convenient, and not enjoyable.  I since then have had another child and decided to get the playtex even though the lactation consultant recommended the medela because that is what most hospitals sell.  I absolutely loved the playtex. It was comfortable with its rubber padding and adjustable settings. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants an enjoyable breastfeeding experience. I ended up breast feeding for 9 months (the first three while I was going to nursing school) the second time around and intent to do the same with our third child.",5
Playtex Embrace Double Automatic Breastpump,Great prodcut! i shopped everywhere before making a choice.  I used a Medela pump for 3 months and thought i couldn't find anything better but this is! it has a nice discreat case and is easy to clean and operate! Great Bargin for the price! I would recommend this to anyone!,5
Playtex Embrace Double Automatic Breastpump,"I love this pump, then why the 1 star?  I bought this pump when my first son was born.  After using it for about a month the motor died on me.  Playtex was fantastic, sending me a new motor free of charge over night.  I only used the pump about one more month and then it went into storage.  I took it out when my second son was born and used it for about 4 months when the motor died again!  I called Playtex and they informed me the motor has a one year warranty from day of purchase and so I had to shell out $100 for a new motor plus extra money for overnight shipping (didn't include 2 business days of processing).  They informed me that the motor is only good for about 300 hours of use.  That's really not a lot if you're a full time working mom.  It should last you through one child, but if you plan to have more than one you should plan to shell out extra money for a new motor.",1
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Stretch the Giraffe Take Along Toy,My nephew is 5 months old this was his Christmas present. He looked at it funny at first but now he chews on its nose and he's smiling about it.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Stretch the Giraffe Take Along Toy,"My wife and first came across the Lamaze brand by accident.  Our 4 month old loves Freddie the Firefly.  We bought Stretch the Giraffe for some variety - it's excellent.  We like Freddie Firefly because of the mirror and the crinkle wings.  Stretch has a different texture to the legs and our son loves pulling on them.He loves cuddling the toy and entertaining himself with it, which is a huge lifesaver when you want some ""me time"" to get stuff done.This is a great price on Amazon.  It's $5 more at [...].",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Stretch the Giraffe Take Along Toy,"For whatever reason my kid loves this giraffe we got the same brand of another toy and he won't touch it. I would recommend this as a shower gift for friends, or for your own baby. My kiddo is 7 mo old and can't get enough of it. Fits length wise into his torso so he can get a grip on it well.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Stretch the Giraffe Take Along Toy,This has become my 5 month old's favorite toy! We don't go anywhere without it.  She even uses its soft ears as a teething toy!,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Stretch the Giraffe Take Along Toy,"This WONDERFUL giraffe was given to us as a baby gift. From the very start, my daughter has loved this giraffe!! She likes to nibble on his ears and tail. She loves to play with the legs and cuddle with him, We can not leave the house without taking him with us! She got him when she was only about a month old, and she is almost 9 months old now, and still loves him. He has become quite a good friend for her :) I highly recommend Stretch the Giraffe, and we will have to buy another one incase she loses him.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Stretch the Giraffe Take Along Toy,I hang this on a clip on the mat I put my grandson on. He loves having the legs practically dangle in his face and loves to pull on them. And he doesn't lose interest in them at all. Lamaze makes great toys for infants!,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Stretch the Giraffe Take Along Toy,"The toy is nice, but definitely not as good as some of Lamaze's other take along toys (check out Captain Calamari). The legs barely stretch and the rings around the neck are sort of odd since they're sewn in place (can't really grab them or chew on them). Each foot makes different noises but a baby won't really have enough finger strength to squeak the squeaker. Bottom line, my child was bored with it.",3
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Stretch the Giraffe Take Along Toy,My 6 month old son LOVES this giraffe. It has tons of interesting texture and fun noises to keep him entertained during play time. He really likes the squeaker in the foot- makes him smile every time.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Stretch the Giraffe Take Along Toy,My 8 month old son loves this giraffe.  We have several other Lamaze products and I am very happy with this brand.  Shipping was prompt and accurate also.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Stretch the Giraffe Take Along Toy,This giraffe as well as all of the Lamaze toys we have are great.  They are really well made.  The different textures and colors fascinate my baby girls.  The girls liked to just look at them when they were really little but love them even more now that they are 7 months.  Highly recommend!,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Stretch the Giraffe Take Along Toy,Great as a first toy. Clip in on your stroller and your very young baby will love it! He will be fascinated by the bright colors and later hen he can hold it he will have fun exploring the textures.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Stretch the Giraffe Take Along Toy,I bought this for my granddaughter shower gift.  She loves Giraffes and this has a nice selection of activities for the baby.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Stretch the Giraffe Take Along Toy,I really love all the Lamaze toys that I have purchased and this is no exception. I am very happy with this one.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Stretch the Giraffe Take Along Toy,"I first bought this giraffe for my nephew, who immediately loved the lil' guy. When I saw my nephew playing with it, I decided to purchase one for my own little baby. She was too young to play with it when I bought it, but she is now at the perfect age to play with it (4 months). Anything that touches her hand is immediately grabbed, and this toy is no exception. I love this toy because there are a lot of easy-to-grab parts on it for her little hands. The rings around the neck, the legs, and the tale are perfect handholds. However, at her age, her hands are still a little small for the giraffe so she loses her grip and drops it frequently.  I wish its legs were thinner so she could hold onto it easier. I also think the color sceme is excellent, because it is colorful enough with contrasting colors to grab her attention. My favorite is that the tummy is a black and white checked fabric - Hello fascination! Once she catches sight of the tummy she won't look away. Not only does it look cute, but it also has a lot of sounds; the ears and one foot is crinkly, and the feet have squeakers or rattles in them. My only complaint is that the head is backwards...Unlike the picture, where the giraffe faces forward, my daughter's giraffe's head is turned so it is looking behind it. A little complaint, but still annoying.I highly recommend this toy for a go-to baby shower gift. All little babies will love how interactive and engaging the giraffe is, and moms will like how cute it is.",4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Stretch the Giraffe Take Along Toy,"My four month old grandson enjoys holding onto the legs of this toy. It rattles, it's colorful, and has a variety of textures.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Stretch the Giraffe Take Along Toy,"I got this item for my godchild for Christmas.  So when I got the package, I was totally happy with it.  It's totally cute and colorful!  What you see in the photos is how the item really looks like.  I'm sure my godchild will totally love this!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Stretch the Giraffe Take Along Toy,"I am the original writer of the previous Warning post! Thank you M. Windham for posting my story for me. I am glad my word travelled FAST today!YES....this toy is a danger. Lamaze actually sells several other ""characters"" similar to stretch that appear to have this same issue. Very THIN fabric and POOR single stitching is all that comes between your baby's mouth and SMALL parts, rattles and stuffing inside the feet. The rattles and squeakers are the PERFECT size for lodging in your babies throat.Take this thing away please before they unsuspectingly chew the stitchings off the same way my son did. My son is okay, but it's the principal and what if's that get me about this!  How could that be over looked?? I love Lamaze toys, but will seriously be weary of thier products from now on.-Tiffany In TX",1
Lamaze My First Fishbowl,This is a very cute toy with different sounds and textures for baby to explore. My kid never understood the in and out concept. Even now that she's 2 she pretends she drinking the water from the bowl rather than putting the toys in and out.,3
Lamaze My First Fishbowl,"I bought this toy for my daughter when she was three months old.  That was, perhaps, ambitious on my part.  She didn't really ""play"" with it, but did enjoy it when I squeeked the clam or rattled the yellow fish.  She's now 8 months old and as she's gotten older, this toy has been a keeper.  I can take it with me, dump in the four toys that come with it and a couple other rattle balls, and it'll keep her company, amused, and happy for visits, eating out, picnics, etc.  She's JUST starting to understand the clear plastic sides and the need to reach into the bowl to grab the toys as opposed to trying to break through the sides to get at what she can see but not reach.  I like that it's teaching a form of permanence.  Mostly, though, I like that this is something that I've gotten lots of use out of with the little one.  Not her very favorite toy at any given time but a keeper nonetheless.",4
Lamaze My First Fishbowl,I bought this for my 6 month old cousin for Christmas. My 11 month old daughter has liked playing with this toy since she was 6 months old. She likes to take the fish out of the bowl and put them back in. Great for motor skills. The water filled sides of the fish bowl are fasinating to  her too. Mom likes this toy too because it doesnt make any noise.,3
Lamaze My First Fishbowl,I bought this for my 6 month old boy/girl twins and it is still a favorite ""quiet"" toy.  They are now 10 months so it's held their interest longer than most of our other toys.  It's great to pack up and hold other toys for a car ride or trip in the stroller over to the park.  They now shake up the water and marvel at the pieces moving inside and the bubbles they've created.  The fishbowl is easy to clean as are most of the toys - the terry clam is a little dingy but cleans up well enough.  Would definitely recommend!,5
Lamaze My First Fishbowl,This toy was displayed with water between the plastic on the sides of the bowl. It did not arrive as the display or picture showed and was a disappointment.The toy is cute but the water would have been fascinating to an adult or baby.,4
Lamaze My First Fishbowl,"I bought this toy for my three nieces and nephews for Christmas and heard such good things about it that I wanted one for our own daughter, even though I think I bought it a little early for her to be very interested in it at first. I brought it back out recently and she's showing a lot of interest in the little fish and I think their bright colors and different textures keep her intrigued. I actually like how they roll around and sometimes pop out of her reach because it makes her reach for them and seriously consider crawling to get them.She hasn't quite picked up the talent of putting them back in the fish bowl, but we're working on that! I think it's a great toy and well thought out to keep young children amused for some time!",5
Lamaze My First Fishbowl,"My five month old daughter enjoys this toy immensely.  The crinkly crab is her favorite creature, followed by the jingly fish.  She also really likes the bowl itself.  I can already see her trying to figure out how to grab the toys through the plastic, which she can't.  I then get to show her how to take the toys out of the top.  This will surely help her develop her concepts of in and out.  Right now she quite adeptly empties the toys out of the bowl by dumping it upside down over her head, which is fine because the creatures are soft and light!",5
Lamaze My First Fishbowl,"My daughter has had this toy since she was about 9 months old (now 17 months old) and she does like it but it's not anywhere near her favorite. My daughter will every once in a while play with the toys (taking them out and putting them back in) but mostly she throws all four toys out of the fish tank and then moves on. If this was a $5 toy that would be fine but I think it's WAY over priced. It was a present and I hope the person that bought it for her got it on sale because for $20 something much better could have been purchased.Also, the four ""fish"" toys included are very similar to many dog toys so if you have a dog in the house beware.",3
Lamaze My First Fishbowl,"At first glance, this may appear to be a very simple, really simple toy.  But looks can be deceiving as they were for me when I was searching for that perfect toy for my grandson who is 9 months old.  At first, I did pass it by without a second look because I was sure there was nothing he could do with this toy and have any fun let alone learn anything.  Boy, was I wrong.  After searching the web for several hours (we know how that goes, don't we?) I returned to the Amazon toy department.  I have now learned that if you are looking for toys, shop no further than Amazon!  I purchased this My First Fishbowl, and when I received it, I was just about bowled over at how cute it was.  There are so many details about this toy that a toddler of 9 months won't remember until he's about 2!  Each fish is different.  Each fish makes a different sound.  Each fish is a different color in different fabrics new to a baby's touch.  Then, there's the fishbowl itself!  It is made so well of such quality material that my grandson found it just as much fun to play with the empty bowl.  The inside of the bowl is actually lined with a pillow-soft, satin, water-design fabric that is very attractive to the little ones.  The clear sides are of touch vinyl that won't give way to any abuse by someone for whom this is made.  It's so neat that even I like playing with it.  This is as good as it gets, and I hope to purchase more toys made by Lamaze.  If you want fun--if you want learning--you get both with this toy.",5
Lamaze My First Fishbowl,Oh my gosh this child is just enamored with this fishbowl one of the best things you've ever made for the young ones!,5
Lamaze My First Fishbowl,"Very cute.  Clever baby toy.  Each of the little creatures in the &#34;bowl&#34; is small enough to be held easily and makes a sound.  Bought it for my granddaughter who was fascinated by the critters ( they are very cute) and the ability to put them in, take them out, and see them.  Great toy.",5
Lamaze My First Fishbowl,5 toys in one. Sometimes my baby is plain interested in the empty fishbowl. It is a nice size and nice colours which is a given for Lamaze brand toys.,5
Lamaze My First Fishbowl,My daughter began to play with this toy at 6 months and is still enjoying it daily at 9 months.  Lamaze toys are great because they are soft and don't cause any harm when baby bangs them against their head or falls over on them.,5
Lamaze My First Fishbowl,"I got this for my 6m baby for her first Christmas.  She really loves it.  The clam squeaks, the starfish and fish are rattles, and the crab is crinkly.  She loves playing with all of them with her hands and mouth.  It's fun for us to put things in the bowl and pull them out.  I would recommend this.",5
Lamaze My First Fishbowl,This toy is perfectly made and selling at a wonderful price - but it doesn't seem to hold my 9 month old son's attention very well at all. Bummer!! Still at least 4 stars for looking cool in my opinion... :),4
Lamaze My First Fishbowl,"My mother bought this toy for my youngest brother in 2001. It is the exact same toy, but in different colors. I found it in storage and washed the items and gave the toy to my 6 month old daughter. It is hands down her favorite toy of all time. She plays with it all the time. I love that it is QUIET, and it's adorable, of course. Obviously it is a sturdy that will stand the test of time, which is important when you are going to pay almost $20 for a baby toy. It will definitely be an item you can pass down to younger siblings - or even your grandchildren, in our case! I would recommend this item to anyone trying to shop for a nice baby toy for an infant 3-12 months.",5
Lamaze My First Fishbowl,"I gave it 3 stars as it is quite a cute idea, but meanwhile I have seen other fish bowls that cost  a little more ,but much more solid.",3
Lamaze My First Mirror,"I read the reviews on this product and was aware that some had stated that the purple-framed mirror gave a distorted image.  The trouble with that is you don't get a choice when ordering.  You get what they give you.  So I took my chances and I got the purple-framed mirror.  The image is distorted.  I was kind of hoping that the other reviewers were being just a little too picky, but nope.  I will say that the image is clear from most angles, but as soon as you place a finger on the mirror it becomes distorted.  This wouldn't be a problem except that most babies as they grow older like to touch their mirror image.  The reason it becomes distorted (in my opinion) is because the mirror is a safety mirror.  It's paper thin.  The construction otherwise seems adequate, although I haven't taken it out of the box yet.  I'm still deciding whether to return it or not.  I like the idea that the mirror is removable so that you can place it in a crib or stroller or wherever.  It just seems kind of expensive to pay for something that you're not completely happy with.  The trouble is that it's hard to find a floor mirror for babies anywhere else!",3
Lamaze My First Mirror,The toy is cute like all Lamaze toys but the mirror - which is the most important part of it - is not like a regular mirror.Other reviews said the mirror is great but I disagree.,3
Lamaze My First Mirror,"I bought this for my son when he was born. It was great to use for tummy time. When he was learning to sit up, I would put this on his lap and he LOVED looking at himself and enjoyed touching his reflection in the mirror. I also had him feel all of the colorful, soft, and textured fabrics the mirror is made out of. This is a ""safer"" toy for babies to use as it is soft and they cant get hurt. The mirror is flexible plastic -not the clearest thing in the world -but it does the job. As far as cleaning this toy -I just used dreft wipes -cleans up nicely.As he got older, he used this mirror while sitting in his high chair. He is now almost 14 months old, and still enjoys the mirror.I just ordered this mirror as part of a baby shower gift for a friend. She cant wait to use it!",5
Lamaze My First Mirror,"I read the recent reviews warning that the mirror is horribly distorted, but I thought perhaps people had unrealistic expectations for a safety mirror.  I wish I had listened to the reviews because this product is bad, even for a safety mirror.  The distortion is so severe that I can't look at it without hurting my eyes.  The reason I gave this product two stars, rather than one, is that the design is cute and a wedge is a great idea for tummy time.",2
Lamaze My First Mirror,My 9 month old baby girl is in love with this thing it is safe and fun to watch her play with it. The seller got the product out quickly with no problems i give the seller and the product my full support.Thank you,5
Lamaze My First Mirror,"This is probably the best baby mirror I have seen.  It's portable, light weight, and easy to clean.  This is a two-in-one mirror.  It can attach to the crib, which is where our's is primarily.  Or you can keep it fastened to the wedge and baby can use it for entertainment during tummy time.  What's great about this mirror is that it's just a mirror.  Not a bunch of toys to distract from the real purpose of the mirror: for baby to see himself!  Baby will also love it's bright colors and patterns that all Lamaze products are known for.  What's nice about putting this mirror up in the crib is that you'll get a little more sleep.  Our boy wakes up and goes straight for the mirror and plays by himself for a good half an hour to an hour.  When our boy was a newborn he did not like tummy time until we placed this mirror in front of him.  He thought it was hilarious that he could watch himself get close and far away from the mirror.  Great product.",5
Lamaze My First Mirror,"I admit at first I wasn't too impressed w/this mirror...I think because I bought it when my daughter was around 4 months so there wasn't much that she could do w/it but now she is 8 months and LOVES playing w/it! The other day the mirror was flat on the ground in front of her and I caught her peeking over at herself...she kept doing it again and again. I love how you can angle it any way. I set it up and call to her and she tries to crawl to get to it. She loves to pick it up, stare at herself, bang it, and chew it. 5 stars!",5
Lamaze My First Mirror,"I purchased this mirror for my daughter at 2 1/2 months.  She loved seeing her reflection and the bright patterns of the material.  The clarity of the mirror is great, not distorted, and flexible so it's safe.  I also love how you can position the mirror in so many ways depending on how she's sitting or laying.  It is rigid enough for stability but soft enough for play and bumps (she is now 4 months and very ""grabby"").  I would recommend this product!",5
Lamaze My First Mirror,"The mirror I got sent was one with a purple frame, not the one on the main picture which has an orange frame. I would have preferred the orange colored mirror frame but still kept it. However, I was very disappointed of the quality of the mirror. It is not at all that clear as it is shown on the product page of Amazon. My guess is that the product was changed and the customers who got the orange framed mirror were lucky, those who got the purple framed mirror were not.",2
Lamaze My First Mirror,"Great little toy for the young ones - mine loved it!  However, it did not take much abuse and the seam broke after a few months with the stuffing coming out.  So beware!",1
Lamaze My First Mirror,"Love this mirror!  My daughter still loves this mirror at 19 months old!She didn't use it too much for tummy time but I loved the idea of the sturdy block holding it up as opposed to some of the folding tummy time mirrors that just tip over.I took it off the block, I used the velcro straps on the back of it (that hold it to the block), to put it in her crib and she absolutely loves having it there.  Every time she wakes up, she talks to herself in the mirror and just plays.  It's so cute.No frills mirror, but it has been fabulous for my daughter!  I like the colors too, just like all the lamaze toys' colors!",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"This product's best feature is that it plugs into a power outlet.  I had the Aquarium Swing prior to this one and the Rainforest Cradle Swing is nice, I just wish it had more bells and whistles like the Aquarium Swing did.  Overall, my daughter loves this swing.  Another nice feature that is that the seat swivels 180 degrees and she can sit upright or recline in it.  I just wish the tray had some toys that she could play with.  My  daughter is 4 months old.  We just attached rings to the tray and she loves to bat at them.",4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"My baby loves this swing.  When he is fussy, it really calms him down.  The mobile is a nice touch.  He loves to stare at the stuffed animals (and talk to them too!)",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"We have the Baby Papasan Cradle Swing which is an excellent product.  My wife and I thought we would purchase one of these as well since it plugs in and looks to be almost the same as the Papasan swing.  Hmm, well it isn't at all the same.  The design is acually an improvement as the swing is much more stable.  The seat is not fully inclosed in plastic like the Papasan swing so the baby seems to be a bit more comfortable as the seat adjusts to the baby's weight.  The swing is also brightly colored and the mobile portion is very cute.  So far so good right?The swing seems to be great. . . until you turn it on.  It just does not swing.  There may as well be one speed as the device BARELY moves at all.  Even with the nothing in the swing, it barely rotates at all and simply does not function.  Also, the music is not very calming and you cannot adjust which song you would like to hear.  Instead, it cycles through all the songs in order therefore, you always HAVE to hear the same songs.I am not sure if the swing that we received was broken and that caused all of the problems with this device since I am the first one to review this product.  If you do deceide to purchase this swing, just make sure that you can return it in case it is a problem with the swing.",1
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"My baby has never been a swing baby. Some babies are, some babies aren't. He was just starting to be able to fall asleep in the swing, when it broke at months. Now even though my son doesn't love the swing, it is still a place to safely place your little one while you run to the bathroom, grab a drink, etc. I was so annoyed. We used the thing maybe a maximum of 20 minutes a day. Luckily, the warranty is for a year, so I was able to have Fisher Price send me out a replacement motor. I will update if anything goes wrong.",3
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,This is a great swing. My baby loves it. I like how you can have it swing both side to side and front to back. Only thing I would change is to have a switch to turn the volume of the music down. I like how you can plug it into the wall or it can run on batteries.,4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"My son loves this swing! He's slept in it since the day we brought him home from the hospital. It's a little large-you need a 4ft x 4 ft space for it- but when it hushes a screaming baby you'll know it's worth it. The mobile is brightly colored and holds a baby's attention and the music is soothing. The swing plugs into a wall outlet, which is a great feature: baby accessories require a lot of batteries, which can get expensive!",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,Our twin boys didnt really like this swing until they were 4 1/2 months old...they would cry and fuss to get out (guessing the colors were too much stimulation for them?).  Now they are mesmerized by the mobile and enjoy the side to side motion.  Nice that it plugs in and has an electric mobile.  Easy to change from side to front mode.  Overall we are happy with this.,4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"We just finished putting it together and I agree with the other poster who says it doesn't swing much.  It hardly goes 3 inches off center, no matter what the speed setting is.  I think there must be a manufacturing defect because the swing just doesn't move as much as I remember the one in the store moving.  We got ours to swing a little faster on occasion and if you let it warm up long enough, but so far I am disappointed.I like the music, but the controls are definitely lacking.  The controls feel cheap and it's difficult to click them into the place you intend because the settings are so close to each other.I am thinking there is a problem with the motor/controls and will be revisting Babies R Us to see if I need a new motor.UPDATE: I did find that the first swing was defective.  The replacement swing is much quieter and actually swings.  If your swing makes a clicking noise, take it back to the store!I'd rate this swing a 3.5 or 4 now.  I love the plug in feature, but I still have gripes about not being able to cycle through the music.  The buttons themselves can also stand to be improved.  Finally, it would be nice if the seat had more recline options.",2
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"My daughter hated the front-to-back swing we originally purchased and would scream within a minute of putting her in it. I bought this swing after hearing some babies prefer the side-to-side motion of the cradle swing, and hoping for a miracle. Well it works! It definitely calms her down and she loves looking at the mobile.PROS: Can be used as cradle or regular swing as the seat swivels. Great songs that won't drive mom & dad nuts! Can be plugged into wall or runs off batteries. Goes together fairly easily and quickly.CONS: Takes up a lot of room. The mobile on mine is messed up. It clicks and struggles to turn. It could've been something I did when putting it together. Only good until baby is 20 lbs. but hopefully by then you won't need the swing anymore.I'd recommend this swing before any other. It just offers so many options.",4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,My 2 Months old is enjoying this. Not sure how long can be used as its meant for just 25 pounds.Music Mobile could have been better I would have rated 5 stars,4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"Got this yesterday after maybe 4 days shipping which was super fast! Husband put it together in less than 30 minutes, love that it plugs in and makes such sweet music. Can't wait for baby to use it!",4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"i recently received my order and was very disappointed . i was really hoping for the swing pictured here but received something completely different . and it is no where near the quality of the one pictured. the seat and straps are cheaply made and there is no cushion support in the seat of the swing. praying that they get back to me quickly to help resolve the issue, i did assemble the swing to see if i liked it and dont. please check before orderingmother of three. had the swing pictured for all of them until it gave out after 3 kids",1
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"The swing was a lifesaver for my newborn with reflux. It sometimes stops on it's own and I have to turn it off and back on, but so far so good. Very pleased!",4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,Bought this for my one month old grsndson has some issues with colic (gas) just like his grandpa Made his mom and dad very happy cons none usua fast service from amazon,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"I bought this for my DIL after her baby swing stopped working.  The previous swing had been by the same maker.  She much prefers everything about this swing and has had no problems with it.  There are more choices of positions for the seat, and my grandbaby is happier in this swing.  The only drawback is that it is a bit of a pain to assemble.",4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,This is a great swing and my son loves it....he didnt pay much attention to the mobile in the beginning but he is now 2 months and starting to notice things and now he looks for the mobile to turn as soon as i lay him in it LOL. He falls right to sleep in this swing every time i put him in it. I love it!! I am able to get so much stuff done while he naps in the swing. I love you can adjust the speed of the swing and also that you can pick what kind of music/sounds you want to play. LOVE IT!!,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,Product received is exactly what was described.  I would recommend this product.  Everything works well.,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"We were 3 weeks into adjusting to the new member of our family.  We had the Fisher Price Rainforest bouncy chair, but it seemed to lose its soothing qualities as our little girl started to become more active than just an eating, sleeping, pooping machine.  The vibration on the bouncy chair still works, but she really enjoys rocking in our arms.  We decided on purchasing the travel swing, but it was not available in the store so we ""upgraded"" to the Cradle Swing.  Well, it is quite evident that she loves the swing since she falls asleep within minutes of being placed in the seat.  We exclusively use the power adapter and have had no problem with the amplitude of the swing.  In fact, with our 7 pound baby, we need to keep it at setting 2 or below to prevent it from swinging too much.  Our guess is that as she gains weight we will have to increase the setting.  She enjoys looking at the mobile, as much as a 4 week old can.  We would strongly recommend this open top swing despite its $120 price tag.  The swing has already paid for itself in the hours of soothing calmness that it has provided.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"We love it so much.my baby love her nap time.she love the toys the music, color everything is nice .",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"My 9 week old loves this swing.  She will sit for hours watching the animals go around in circles over her head.There are a couple of issues that make me rate it a 4 star instead of 5:1)  it is very noisy - you can hear the motor running2)  the plugs come loose very easily and then you have to figure out if it has detached at the leg or behind a piece of fabric3)  it is impossible to change the reclining position4)  enormous5)  you need to make sure that the legs are completely level or they will come off of the floor while in the highest speed setting - not enough to tip (yet???) but enough to make you spend about 5 minutes moving the legs so that it doesn't tipGreat things:1) plug in no batteries, yeah!!!!2)  colors3) variable speeds4)  music5)  ability to move seat different positionsoverall we love this swing and the pros definitely outweigh the cons",4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"This swing is the only one I could find that had the plug-in option, obviously better for the pocketbook and environment than a battery eater. However, the seat is pitched back so far that my 4 month old always cranes his neck to look around and looks uncomfortable. Fisher Price could add months of usefullness to this product by just adding another tilt option so babies who want to sit up can. I have had it for a month and a half and wish I could justify the price and size it's taking up in my apt. Should have bought it earlier!",3
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"Everything by Fisher Price is craptastic.  This swing in no exception.Despite the cheap materials (plastic and polyester) we expected the motor to work.I tried the swing with an 8 pound weight and it worked weakly.  Ahen with a 16 pound weight and the swing barely budged.I phoned Fisher Price.  They told me if the product is in warranty, they can send a motor.  If not, I will have to pay $50 for one.I have combed through so many swing reviews on Amazon.  Crappy motors are very typical of Fisher Price.  Some people have gone through 3 or 4 motors in a year.How many of these throwaways end up in landfills every year?  Makes me think they make these lousy on purpose.  So you can never actually use a swing with more than one kid.This swing is crap and it is going back.Mamaroo here we come....",1
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"I bought this for my second child. I already had a regular old Graco swing. Nothing wrong with it just old and outdated compared to what is available since my first was born in 2009. I tried this swing at our church and I loved it. Had to have it. I bought it from my phone right then and there. I love that it plugs in!! Why didn't anyone come up with that before! SO many batteries so much wasted money. I love all the sounds and music it makes and the volume is just able to adjust. It's easy to fold up and took it with me for long weekend stays. It was easy to assemble. It also turns sideways direction. My daughter loved that. She took many naps in this, it was great until she got too big. It did start to slow down a bit as she grew and I had to put it on the highest setting. It wouldn't stop me from buying. Great swing.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"After three months I was so tired of holding my LARGE baby 24 hours a day.  He would not sleep if I put him down.  He would scream.  I was beginning to think he had colic.  The only thing that soothed him was his crib mobile.  We had gotten the other Fisher Price power plus swing and he absolutely would not sit in it! So I decided to go ahead and put him in this one in the store and by manually moving it back and forth (snice the stores are too cheap to put batteries in it) he just sat back, relaxed, and started cooing at the mobile (which wasn't even moving)  So we bought the swing.  It was soooo EASY to put together compared to the aquarium swing that I had had for my 3 year old when he was a baby.  It has soothing music, which we mostly use now.  AND it also has an upbeat music selection for play time.  The swing also has 2 different nature settings which we have not used yet so I'm guessing they are probably useless?  But who cares if it has more features then you actually use?  This swings motor is VERY quiet compared to the grinding motors of most of the other swings we have been through (quite a few as i have 4 sons) Since my baby is large I always use the highest swing setting and it moves just fine.  I'm not sure why others have had a problem with the swing not swinging since my 3 motnh old is a big boy compared to other kids his age.  For the people who gave it a bad review for this reason every fisher price swing i have ever tried will not move with an extremely active or crying baby so this is not a defect, its simply so when your baby falls asleep the swing doesnt give your baby whiplash.  I do not think fisher price will ever correct this problem and i dont blame them (lawsuit city!)  In my opinion, Baby's do not need to be swung back n forth like a kid at a playground who is trying to go faster and faster.  The mobile is at a great angel by the child's feet for better viewing.  It is stated on most crib mobiles to place your baby so his feet are under it not his head.The only thing I would have done differently is added another adjustment so baby can sit up better for playtime.  and maybe add some toys on the tray.  The matching high chair is a lot better for playtime.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,We bought this swing for a our son when he was a month old and we couldn't have been happier and neither could he. When I was reading the reviews on this swing a lot of people complained about the motor being loud.. I didn't find this at all. I guess it would be if you had nothing on in your house but the swing. Assembly was very easy as well and the motor seemed strong enough to swag my son the entire time he used it. We also used it for my daughter who was born two years after my son.I always recommend this swing to friends and family who are having babies. The plug in option is also great! Batteries are just too pricey and they don't last very long... even the rechargeable ones.,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"For all of those who have or are considering a battery-operated swing - one question:  WHY?  Our first swing was borrowed from a cousin and it was battery powered (the aquarium version with the lights, etc.).  EIGHT PACKS of batteries later (4 batteries with each change) - I figured out that for the cost of those batteries - I could have had a new plug-in swing.  Duh.  Learn from my mistake and don't waste money on batteries when you can have a plug-in swing with PLENTY of power.Well-designed and thoughtful.  The toys lift up and out of the way for loading/unloading baby (cute toys too and my baby likes how the leaves move up and down).  Controls are easy to understand and there are lots of options (including volume control and a reset button - always good).  Swing can move as a traditional swing (back/forth) and as a cradle swing (side/side).  Two different incline positions.  Easy to set-up and very stable.  You do want to be sure (like any swing) that the feet are on a firm, flat surface.  Works best if you give the swing a little push after you turn it on - don't count on ANY swing having enough power to get to maximum swing without a little push start.  BONUS:  In my experience, the swinging motor is much quieter than the battery-operated swing I used to have.Tunes on the swing are okay.  (Side comment - why don't they make one of these where you can plug in your MP3 player or IPod??)  There is a traditional lullaby setting, a caribbean-style playful music setting (my six-year old likes this one for dancing - great entertainment for baby), a rainforest animal sound setting and then water sounds.I do miss the lights from our old swing (this one has no lighting) and the cradle part of the swing requires a little wider storage than older swings.  But overall - great swing and pros FAR outweigh the cons.  And... you won't be wasting money and resources on batteries.  GREAT DEAL!!",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"This swing has it's good and bad points.The GOOD:-Easy to assemble-Comfortable seat for baby to fall asleep in-Most of the music is not annoying to me-Plugs in to the wall, I've never put batteries in it-Mobile swings out of the way-Swings both directionsThe BAD:-The tray comes down in between the legs, making it difficult to use when you have the baby swaddled or in a nightgown-Now that my baby is around 16+ lbs, the motor is working overtime, sounds noisy, and the swing itself is getting unstable.  I think I may have to retire it long before he hits the actual weight limit of the swing.I'm disappointed that this swing is not going to last much longer.  It seems to be one of the best things for my baby when he gets wound up.  But lately one of the legs is rising up off the floor when he is swinging. If you have a smaller baby, it will probably work well for you.  It would work better if the tray was removable or there was no leg center piece.",4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"My husband and I purchased this swing for our daughter because it has an A/C adaptor and doesn't require batteries. We had only had the swing for three weeks and with very limited use, and the gear box in the motor kept messing up. We had to swing the swing manually in order to get it to work. We were able to get a new gear box/motor from Fisher Price, and after two uses it is already doing the same thing! My brother told me that he had the same experience with the swing. I wish I had known BEFORE we purchased it!",1
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"I bought this swing for my 2 month old.  He likes the music a lot.  I use the slower music for naps.  Now when he hears the music, he knows it's nap time and barely fusses.  I can see him start to relax and go into sleepy mode.  I also like that the swing moves front-to-back and side to side.  It gives our baby some versatility in what he's able to see and aloows me move the swing to lots of spaces.  I love that it also plugs in!  My baby uses the swing a lot so this really helps save on batteries.  It seems comfortable for him and it's also easy to clean.  The only con:  He's 4 months old now and rarely looks at the overhead mobile and when he does, it's not for long.  I think it doesn't sit in a comfortable position for him.",4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"This swing is AWESOME!!!!  I have a small child care center and my babies LOVE this swing.  Most seem to like the cradle position.  I love that it plugs into the wall as opposed using all of those D batteries all the time.  So, it saves me a bundle!!!",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"The ""hammock"" like feel of this swing did not appeal to my child at all, she had the Aquarium cradle swing before (from her older sister) and when it broke I purchased this one, she just screamed and screamed. If it had the solid seat like the aquarium swing it would have been great, but she really needed to have that secure feeling of being held in place.  Beautiful swing, loved that you could plug it in too - wish I could have switched the seat out I would have taken it anyday over the battery guzzling Aquarium swing...",3
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,My daughter loves this swing. It is worth every penny. The swing has been a life saver on many occasions. We love that you have the option to plug it in or to use batteries. It does take up a bit of space but we opted for this one over the travel size swing. The swing offers several music selections and diffent levels of power on the swinging motion. Overall a great product. Our daughter is 6 months and still loves it.,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,Great features! Swings from front to back or side to side. The fact that it doesn't require batteries because it comes with an AC adapter is priceless.,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"There are aspects of this product that were really good.  I enjoy the option to plug in the swing, instead of having to use batteries.  I also enjoyed the option to switch from side to side or front-to-back swinging motion.  The mobile held my son's interest for about a month, and then he got bored.  The music/rainforest noises stopped working after about two months, which was very irritating.  However, while they did work, they were not annoying or obnoxious.Overall I enjoyed this swing, but would not purchase it again.  I will probably donate it to Goodwill.",3
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"Even though the swing takes up a bit of space, the Fisher-Price Rainforest Cradle Swing is well worth the space. The fact that it can operate with or without batteries due to the plug-in feature is the main reason I purchased it. These options make it possible to use the swing anywhere. It also has a nice variety of options such as the ability to swing side to side or front to back along with several positions, sounds and speeds. Once the basics are acquired such as a crib and car seat, be sure to purchase this swing or one like it for yourself or as a gift. Nothing has helped our family's colicky babies like time in a swing.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"this is a great swing, very comfy for the baby, my baby used to take all her naps in it, reclines, you can change positions if the baby gets bored. great colors, the toys are the best toys ever, big with big eyes, my baby will smile and talk to them all the time, you can charge it electrically which is great ...it has 4 kinds of music, we used mostly the one for sleeping , very soothing, my baby will sleep within minutes. the only problem is that the music stopped working after 3 months of use, which was very disappointing to me, because it was very good feature. I have the rainforest gym mat which I used its music for sleep and it worked. the rainforest collection is the best! though the same toys but my baby never gets bored of them.",4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"I was super excited for this swing, because it plugged in and I'd hoped it would be quiet. It's not loud, but it definitely makes noise. I also don't really like the seat-it's not a papasan like I wanted. It's a good swing for the price, and the plug-in feature is great, but I wish I'd spent the extra $25 and gotten one of the nicer Fisher Price options. Our boy is 8 weeks old and 15 pounds, so we'll see how it holds up as he grows. I'll admit, I'm nervous about it-doesn't seem super beefy. The mobile is very colorful and cute, altho I wish it had a mirror or lights. The music/sound options are pretty good.",3
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,This is the best swing out on the market right now.  It's so colorful and it's heaven for an infant.,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,I got this as a gift before I had my son. He enjoys this swing a lot. He was given this swing and a take along swing. Though honestly is the take along swing had a plug in option I would probably have given this one up. As I said it is pretty bulky and does not really store well unless you take it completely apart which can be problematic in a smaller space. It has provided many hours of comfort to my son though from newborn to five months and counting.,4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,Bought this for our new Grandson.  We absolutely love it.  Has an ac/dc plug- never run out of batteries..Extremely quick shipping and FREE,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"the mobile attached to the swing is wonderful. My sweet little granddaughter is already try to reach for the colorful creatures. Love the battery/plug in feature, sure saves on batteries!",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"We have had this swing for 3 months.  I like how the seat reclines in different positions, and that you can turn it front to side, to the other side! this allows our baby to look all over the living room and dining room. She can watch the couch, the dining room table, or even the TV.I have a small issue with the tray.  I think it could latch a bit better.  My daughter started putting her toes under the tray ledge at about 2 months and pushing up or kicking at it, and is able to unlatch it. This bugs me.  She was not even 11 pounds yet and she could kick the tray open.  Makes me wonder what will happen when she is older and stronger.  Even if it is latched she can kick it open.I love how the swing is portable because with an (actually easy!) push of the button, the legs fold in and I can move it to another room, which I have done a few times with no issues.Of course I LOVE that it plugs in.I have had a scare or two where the swing wouldn't swing.  I panicked, but was able to use the reset button and fix the issue.  I am not sure why this happens.  We probably only use the swing once or twice a day for about 20-30 minutes each time, because she isn't a huge fan of being in one place for too long.  I often wonder why they don't make a swing that vibrates like a bouncy seat?My only other complaint is the VOLUME of this thing.  The lowest volume is too loud.  Although my daughter has no issues sleeping through it, the rest of us do.  Sometimes my husband and I would try to take shifts, but whoever was trying to sleep would be instantly woken up by the swing music... even clear in our bedroom when the swing was in the living room.We found that annoying and have a ""rule"" that if one person is taking a nap, we don't turn the swing music on.",4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"After much searching and reading other people's reveiws on this swing, I decided to purchase it.  When I got it, I was very disappointed with the seat.  Looking at the pictures, I thought that the seat would be like a carseat -- sturdy and padded.  Well, the seat only has a little plastic at the bottom where the legs rest, and the rest of the seat is FABRIC.  My twins are not big -- they are average size (one is 15 pounds & one is 14 pounds).  When they are in the seat, the fabric sucks them in and forces their chin to touch their chest!!!  This is sooooo uncomfortable and they can't stay in the swing for long before they want out.I don't know if I can return this item being that I have already installed it, but I really hate it.  I did see anywere in the online product description that the seat was mostly fabric.  The seat reclines so I guess that is why it is made of fabric.  Had I known this, I would have never bought it.  This is why online shopping is so frustrating -- you can't touch the item so what you get may be different from what you see in the pictures.I hope this helps someone else who is debating whether or not buy this swing.",1
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"this is our second open top cradle swing.  we had the ocean one before and pretty much used it until it died! the best part about this new model is that it has a wall plug! our daughter really loves the up and down movements of the leaves while the animals spin around on the mobile.  i love the fact that the music and mobile are on a timer and after so long turn themselves off.  this model was also less expensive than the first, but we purchased it two years ago when there were no other swings like it. overall great product for the money!",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"10/21/08:  I was so excited when the swing arrived today in the mail.  My 11 day old enjoys car rides, so he will hopefully like a swing!  But then I spent thirty minutes assembling it to discover that 1) the motor is bad and 2) the seat tilts ~20 degrees to the right as mentioned by previous reviews.  The swing has the same (slow) speed at all settings and clicks loudly.  I'm returning it and buying a different swing.Edit added 08/04/12: I called Fisher Price right after my first review (10/08) and they send me a brand new motor (top part) for the swing.  When I called their 800 number a human in Buffalo NY answered the phone, diagnosed the problem with the swing, and had the replacement part there the next day.  This swing is still going, on its third family, after more than three years of swinging.  It is super.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,My 4 month old loves it. It was very difficult to put him to sleep before we had this swing. Now we put him into the swing and he plays for sometime and then goes to sleep. After we received the swing it didn't swing at all. We called Fisher Price and they shipped us a new motor and it worked like a charm. I would recommend this swing.,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"Great product, baby loves the rocking swing motion and the rainforest sounds and toys etc... my only criticism is that with the rocking motion comes a mechanical noise that isn't overly soothing for the baby.  If it wasn't for this noise I would rate the product 5 stars.",3
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,The design of the swing is good. Fisher Price can improve the quality of the sound and the position of the mobile should be more ahead to stay in the line of sight of the baby.,4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"My twins LOVE this swing.  We never attached the tray.  We always buckle them in, but the tray seemed too confining.  Also, someone complained about not being able to take off the tray once you put it on. My daughters love to perch their feet on white bump between the legs.One girl has reflux, and the lower seat setting gives her relief from the reflux pain.  She sleeps in it at night (near her parents.)Make sure you register it in case the motor goes bad.  My motor hasn't had problems.  We've owned it for almost 8 months.  It doesn't swing as high as other swings, but I'm OK with that.It's like having a helper to hold your baby for you whenever you need an extra set of hands.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"This product seems like it would be a good buy when you read about it from purchasing descriptions. Yes, it is ""pretty"" and it has the ""battery saving option"" of a electric outlet adapter. Thing is that the swing starts out very slow--you almost have to give it push to get it going--and then it slows almost to a stop, even on the highest setting...and my baby is only 1 1/2 months old. The battery saving option is not really a plus because the swing never stays on long enough to get much use. It has a ""reset"" button which is supposed to make the improper swinging motion ""snap back into rhythm""--but this feature just does not work. In fact about the only thing that consistently works on this swing is the rotating mobile.After having it at home for less than 24 hours, I have taken the swing back and will be buying a Graco Lovin Hugs swing (based on a friend of mine's much wiser purchase),a battery charger and some re-chargable batteries. Because when it comes down to it the price for all three items is nearly the same, with much better quality...and real music for that matter...not birds chirping and strange ding-dong noises.",2
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"I'm really disappointed. There has been no recall on this product.I had it for ten days and the motor died. Now, I just sit and push.It's not worth the postage to send back.What a shame, and shame on fisher.Their customer service sucks.I have a number of products from them ie the aquarium, which has lost 20% of its water.Their quality has really fallen as of late.Will look elsewhere, advise you do the same.",1
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"We purchased this for my 4 mo old daughter after the second hand swing we bought quit working. One of the things I love about this swing is that it can be plugged into the wall! No more changing batteries and hoping she doesn't wake up. The mobile is a little loud when you turn it on and I personally do not care for the music, but overall, great swing.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"We have 3 month old twins -  a boy and a girl.  We have 2 fisher price swings - one Rainforest for the boy.he just loves the swing.  We set it at the lowest speed and is always plugged in - no batteries.  He loves the music.Spends atleast 5-6 hours a day on the swing. Its been a month since we bought it and the moment his body touches the swing, he is fast asleep.Its very comfortable.  Easy assembly. looks strong too. I would very highly recommend this product to anyone.  don't buy less expensive ones. This is actually 3 toys in one: the swing, working (powered) go-mobile (the rotating thing on the top) and the music.  All of these 3 can be turned ON together or individually.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,It is just what they wanted for their new bundle of JOY. They wanted the side to side swinging. Not the forward and back.,4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"I bought this swing for my son who is now 5 months old.  A friend recommended that I buy this swing because you can choose to swing your child, front to back, or side to side.  We received it in the mail and set it up very quickly.  It is very sturdy and the seat is very soft (we got the little lamb model).  As soon as we brought home our son, we put him in the swing and it put him right to sleep.  The swing is quiet and has a lot of nice features.  I know some people said that it made a loud clicking noise, but our does not.  There is going to be some noise, as there is a small motor in the swing, so no swing will be silent.  We keep ours in the living room and it never bothers us in terms of size or noise.  At times, this is the only place my son will sleep.  He loves it and I have claimed many times, that this is our lifesaver!",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"Before my son was born, I had to have this swing! It is everything I hoped it would be and more. I love the option to go from cradle to front facing, and the battery or plug in use option. It's colorful and the mobile is bright and fun. The 3 different music options are great also. My son is now almost 7 months old and has been using it since birth. He still loves it, we haven't had any problems with it at all. I would recommend this swing to any and everyone!!!",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"I am so glad we have this swing as opposed to any other swing on the market, because we have used it every day for two months, and have yet to put in batteries!  It is the only one we found that you can plug in.  My baby loves it and it is not noisy at all.  I do wish the mobile had some lights or something like the Aquarium version had, but she still enjoys looking at the animals on the mobile anyway.  I would recommend it to anyone that plans on using it more than just rarely.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"We bought this swing for our 3 week old when we realized that she was a baby who demanded to constantly be held - the motif is adorable, the mobile a very convenient way to entertain your infant and the easy transition between swinging styles is an awesome feature. We did have some trouble, however - just 2 1/2 weeks later, the swing motor stopped working. The mobile and music continued to work, but the swing just wouldn't go. The morning after we figured this out, we called Fisher Price and they were great about helping us out - they had us try a few quick fixes, and when none were successful they just offered to send us a new motor housing.So PLEASE do not let any reviews about this problem (which there have been a few) keep you from buying this swing! For $100, you are getting an awesome swing that your baby will love, will look adorable in any room with an animal motif, and will save every new mommy's sanity. If you wind up need to wait a few days for a (completely free) new motor, you still got an awesome deal. Both me and my baby love this swing!",4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,The thing I ordered this swing particularly for is that it seems to sit up more than the other infant swings. I found that my children could use it longer since as they get older they really like to look around and not miss out on anything. I also loved that it would swing in 2 different directions. Front to back & side to side.,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"I was very excited about this swing, however; it has been a big disappointment. Although this is a very cute swing, the motor has never worked correctly. The swing barely moves back and forth. Not worth the money.",1
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"I purchased this swing for my 4 month old daughter.  I was enticed by the fact it was the only one I could locate that could be plugged into an outlet and work off household electricity rather than battery power.  I imagined this would make the ""swing"" consistantly a better ""swing"" as there would never be a weak power source.  The first swing I brought home from the store was assembled (which only took about 15 minutes) and plugged in.  I was immediately disappointed by the lack of swing, and eventually my wife and I determined that there was definitely something wrong with the swing, because even with no baby the swing would stop swinging then slowly...and barely swing again.  I returned it...and purchased another.  I agree with the other reviewer that it just appears to take awhile for it to ""warm"" up.  As I sit and watch her in the swing at this moment, it seems to be working okay, but I'm not totally convinced. The mobile rotates and the leaves move up and down.  If the motor issue could be improved I'd be more pleased with this particular swing.",3
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,Excellent swing. Love the plug in feature. Great rotating seat option. Volume control is parent friendly. Easy to set up. Cute mobile. Open top swing makes getting baby in and out a breez. You wont be disappointed. We had the Ocean Wonders swing before this one...wish we had this one since the beginning daughter falls right to sleep:o) Various nature sounds and lively music.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,My baby is three months and this is his favorite toy. He loves the crinkle wings and that there is so much to explore and chew on. i highly recommend it!,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,nice x-mas gift but It could have came in some sort of box or packaging instead of a plastic bag....i had to find a box to wrap it in.,3
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"The toy is actually smaller than I had anticipated, which is great because it makes it easier for my little guy to hold onto. My five month old loves this toy and it actually keeps him occupied enough that he falls asleep playing with it when we are out! love the ""crinkly"" wings and bright colours. Definitely recommend this toy to anyone. Only drawback is the plastic hook, not the easiest to hook and off the stroller, etc.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"Our son, who's almost 5 months now, LOVES this toy. He's been pretty much obsessed with it for over 2 months now. He has fleeting interest in other toys, but Freddy goes with him everywhere. The entertainment the multitude of colors and textures this toy provides is seemingly endless. Our little one can chew it, it's crinkly, it makes a rattling noise. It's been amazing to watch our son's dexterity improve and his ability to manipulate Freddy grow. Highly recommend it.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,Heard about this toy from other moms saying their babies loved it. It did not disappoint as it is now one of my little girl's favorite toys. We don't go anywhere without it.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,My daughter has other Lamaze toys but this is by far her favorite.  (Maybe she'll grow into the bulkier ones.)  It is lightweight and very easy for her to grasp.  She finds the noise she can make with it rewarding.  It was one of the first toys she showed interest in playing with at 10 weeks and she doesn't tire of it.  I keep it in the car since she needs her favorite toy to get her through lonely car rides.  Highly recommended!,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"We bought Freddie when our little guy was two months old.  He liked Freddie so much that we had to get Buzz a month later.  He loved the black and white pattern on the back at first, and later on he liked to swat the wings to hear the crinkle noises (sometimes it looks as if he's fighting with him). Now he's trying his best keep the little teether in his mouth.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"My six month-old loves this toy.  He is obsessed with tags, and this provides him with lots of different things to touch and feel.  He loves to chew on the rings.  Most importantly, it's light enough for him to pick up on his own.  It attaches easily to a stroller or car seat with attaching rings (buy those separately).  I would recommend this to anyone with a baby!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"I ordered this for my 4 month old for Christmas and she loves it! There are so many fun things to explore and she has no problem holding him in her hands. We had theLamaze Larry the Lion Play & Growfor my older daughter and Freddie is by FAR the better toy. Freddie simply has everything...a teether, a squeaker, crinkles, textures, a mirror, knots, bright colors on one side and black and white contrast patterns on the other. Holds baby's attention and interest. Highly recommend!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"This is our son's favorite toy. It goes with us everywhere we go. Before our son could grab at toys, he loved looking at the black and white patterns on the firefly's back. At three and four months of age he loves to grab at the rings and dangling teether and sucks on them; he also loves to scrunch up the crinkly wings. He has yet to discover the mirror and squeaky wing, but I think he still has to learn how to use these. We hang this from the arch of his tummy time mat and throw it in the car seat wherever we go.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"great toy, all the colours and textures, my baby loves it. i would def. recommend  this item to buy .",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,My 3 month old loves this! We have it hanging from his activity mat and he prefers this over all the other toys. He recently found the teether which really keeps him entertained.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"This toy offers a great way for infants to explore different colors, sounds, and textures. Its kind of like a gold mine of interesting things for the baby! It is much larger than I had anticipated as well which makes it even more worth the price. I can't think of anything that would make this product better. My 4 month old loves gazing at him and touching all the soft materials on him.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,my daughter loves this toy. She loves all the littel features and it clips onto her car seat and she is happy as can bee.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"As usual, it depends, some of my kids have loved it more than others, but it does have lots of features to entertain them!",4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,I bought it for my son. But he did not interested in it. Because it is too colorful and distracted. he could not focus the toy. I  don't recommend it. And also one of my friend bought it for her daughter. And she said that her daughter also doesn't like it.,1
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,It's colorful and is a wonderful item for the activity gym I got for my friend's baby girl. They liked it a lot.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"This was the first toy to which my son visibly reacted in happy recognition, and a year later it is still a favorite. As a ""flying bug"" it lends itself to older kids and adults sort of zooming it around Baby's head and then squeaking it or clacking the rings, to Baby's delight. I was surprised at how young my little boy was when he started investigating the peek-a-boo mirror and the crinkly wings. The bright colors and happy face on the front, and the black-and-white patterns on the back, really do attract and keep Baby's attention. We received this second-hand from someone who told me it was very heavily used at their house as well, so it is very sturdy. It also cleans up nicely with a little dish-soap and water on the surface; the fabrics seem to be engineered so stuff doesn't really stick in the fabric at all.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,My granddaughter loves this one too -- the bright colors keep her attention and she is quiet for quite a while playing with it.  I'm glad I got it for her for Easter rather than a bunny!,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"I bought this when my son was two months old, based on ""Top Ten Best Toys for Infants"" lists, and I can really see why this is consistently at the top of those lists!This toy is large, about a foot long, and is made of a multitude of different brightly colored and textured fabrics for sensory play. The back of the butterfly is in graphic blacks and whites, which really worked for my 2 month old (at the time) since he was mesmerized by the black and white patterns until he got old enough and his vision improved enough to appreciate bright colors too. It comes with a large hook on top so you can hang it into any baby play-yard with an overhead arch, and the hook is sturdy, so your baby can't easily yank it down. The wings are made of crinkly fabric, and it comes with an internal rattle, a squeaker on one wing, a mirror on another wing, and two plastic rings on the bottom so your baby can yank on the butterfly and gnaw on the rings to his heart's content.Somewhat negatives: The hook is pretty thick and sturdy (which is a good thing) but it makes the toy not all that ""Take Along"" as the hook makes it nearly impossible to hang it on the carseat handle...we HAVE done so, but it requires a lot of muscle. Also the toy is a bit heavy and large so you DO have to hang it on something so the baby can play with it, so pairing it with a play-yard of some kind with an overhead arch is almost required.Overall, a great investment! Now my son is six months old, and he still gets hours of playtime out of this butterfly.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"Little did I know when ordering Freddie (with some misgivings that a plush toy would cost around eleven dollars) that he would become an indispensable part of our world. I read all the rave reviews, thought they were probably a little over the top, but figured I'd give him a shot. Since our baby has been two weeks old she has been captivated by Freddie. She started out really liking his black and white side, but now also enjoys his colorful one. It is amazing to me how many features have been packed into this firefly: different colors, textures, a mirror, a squeaker, a teether and crinkly wings, not to mention a handy clip to attach him to almost anything (playmat, stroller, bouncer chair, diaper bag).My only real gripe with Freddie is that the tag says to hand wash only. That being said, I've read several reviews stating that Freddie has survived the washing machine AND dryer, so maybe washing by hand isn't an absolute must. I myself might try the washing machine but am a little leery of putting him (and his cellophane-filled wings) into the dryer. I'm worried a very important of him might melt.Could Freddie be any better? Maybe - if he played music or something. But honestly, this is one toy that is totally worth it. I've even ordered a back up Freddie so he can be in the car with us at all times.Thanks to Lamaze for thinking up such a great toy, and especially to all of the reviewers before me who convinced me to buy this.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"At around the time my baby was 3.5 months' old, I just placed this on his stroller and for the next few months' this was his favorite toy by far. He couldn't keep his eyes or hands off. It kept him  occupied and made him smile.This toy or one of  its variations is a ""must have"" for babies.After my wonderful experience, I make it a point to purchase this for all baby showers",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,I recently got this toy for my son because of all the great reviews on amazon. I will say this is a great distraction toy that he really enjoys. Awesome toy,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,Perfect Toy for baby. Took a while to ship but that is to be expected considering how far it has to travel. Satisfied with seller's sersvice.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"I bought this when my son was about 3-4 months old and first getting into toys. Freddy the Firefly has gone just about everywhere with us and taken quite the beating. Some of the things we really enjoy about Freddy:1. He can clip on to just about anything which is especially nice when baby's favorite game becomes ""watch mommy pick up what I dropped on the floor."" Freddy has been clipped to a car seat, shopping carts, the stroller, and high chairs2: easy to clean, pop it in the washing machine and all it good. Although, after one of many washes the squeaky on one of the wings stopped working3: So many colors and textures!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"Our baby liked this toy early because of the crackle sound Freddie's wings made when he hit it...then he loved to suck on the legs and antennae...then he loved to grab the ring...etc. It seems like all the features on this little firefly are available when your baby gets to the phase where he/she can appreciate them! Great toy because the baby will not easily bore as they grow. My mother-in-law has commented about the weirdness of a big bug for a toy, but even she has acknowleged how much he loves to play with it!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"Personally I think this toy looks pretty fancy. Unfortunately, my baby girl did not show any interest in it in the past few months. Now she is 10 months old already, still has no interest.",1
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"I have no idea why, but this had been his favorite toy from about 2-months to 5-months (and going) It already has sentimental value, so it will never get thrown away.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"My son was given this toy when he was two months, and he was immediately hooked on the black and white patterns on the back.  He's now seven months and still loves this toy more than any other.  I love that one toy lasts through so many developmental stages - colors, textures, sounds, chew toys, etc.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"The sounds, the feel...it's a great toy for a baby learning about her senses.  What a nifty little toy that does so much for a young mind.  I may buy this toy, along with my other gift(s), every time I attend a baby shower because it's so helpful in a baby's development.",5

Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,I love everything about this toy! It's super cute with great colors and I love the crinkle in the wings! Baby loves it too. Well worth the $.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,I have given this same toy to several first time parents and those with their second or third child. It is always a welcome toy. Children play with it for several years.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,I put this on my babys belly while she's in her Snugga bunny swing and she would play with it for a but and fall asleep.  Great toy for her to feel the different textures.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,I bought this for my son when he was about 4 months old. He is now 11 months old and still plays with this toy and loves to teeth on the teether. I would have to say that this toy was a must have for most of our trips and kept him engaged with all of the colors and textures.It is totally worth the money and I would recommend it to all of my friends!!,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"I ordered Freddy the Firefly, Jacques the Peacock & Stretch the Giraffe for my grandson who will be born in May 08.All 3 toys are similar: they all have embroidered eyes, a bell or rattle inside them and one puffy squeaker or squeaker foot and crinkly areas, soft textures, a clasp hook at the top that is stiff plastic and bright colors.Freddy has rings on his tail and a nubby red raspberry hanging from a green string off his right wing that appears to be a teether. He also has a small mirror on his right wing that reflects, but distorts shapes.His body jingles when shaken. His squeaker is a puffy ball on his left lower wing. His backside has black/white polka dots and b/w wavy lines.Based on the pics of babies holding the toy, I though Freddy would be alot bigger. He is a medium sized toy about the size of paperbook book.I'm satisfied with the toy, but will be buying other textured toys for a variety of stimuli and sensations for the baby to enjoy.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"I don't know if the baby likes this toy.But it looks very cute and sweet, nice colors... I love it.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,our son loves this!  we have it hanging in his crib and he often plays with it when he wakes up happily crinkling the wings and batting it.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"Freddie the Firefly became my son's favorite toy, he is 11 months and he goes everywhere with it. It`s educative",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"My niece likes the weird, and this most certainly fit the bill. It is a weird looking firefly (looks like a butterfly to me) that has all sorts of things to discover. You get crinkly sounds on some wings, hidden mirrors on another and teething rings to either put in your mouth or just pull for fun. Now I realize I am writing this review as if an adult will be playing with this. To be honest, when my niece was sleeping I liked to fool around with this thing. It is interesting. Lots of color and very well designed. Easy to clean and will keep any baby entertained during a short car ride to grandma's.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,Bought this for my niece she loves it but it was smaller than I thought it would have been but is a nice size for a new born to stare at and one day play with,4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,The fav toy of my baby boy .. it's the one he can spend long time playing until he fall sleep . .,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,I have purchased several of these toys to add to shower gifts for both baby girls and baby boys.  The toy is delightful:),5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,My 8 month old has been playing with this for 5 months. Well worth the money.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"Our baby has a plethora of toys and this is one of the favorites.  Would highly recommend.  Plenty to look at, services to touch, and seems safe to chew on.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"I bought this when my son was 4 months old and wasn't able to grab toys.  He loved this in the car bc if he moved just right, it would crinkle and entertain him.  Now he is 5 months old, and can grab it and will play with it for quite some time.  It is a really thought toy.  My son loves it.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,I recently ordered this for our son.  He loves it!  The second I gave it to him he started jabbering at it and trying to get the whole thing in his mouth.  The crinkly wings make great noise and the colors are very vibrant.  The reason I ordered this instead of another similar toy is because of the rings that hang from the bottom.  At 3 months old his coordination is really starting to develop and it is easy for him to get and keep a hold of the rings.  I would highly recommend this toy!,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,My little boy loves this toy it is very colorful and he likes to pull at it. I would definitely recommended.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,Our 4 month old loves this toy. This is hands down the best toy we have bought for our baby. We've owned it for 1.5 months and it never gets old. We don't leave the house without it.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"Our babies love this thing. They like to look at it, chew on it, kick it, you name it. Definitely recommend. We also have the zebra. They prefer this one.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"Lo compre para que mi hija jugara cuando estubiera en el carro pero juga con el todo el tiempo, le encanta, lo recomiendo.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"My niece is 3 months old and loves this toy. It isn't too bulky, so it won't be too hard for a baby to maneuver around. The wings are large and easy to grab. She loves to just lay and crinkle them when she's in her bouncer or car seat.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"I decided to get this toy for my 9 month old baby after reading so many great reviews.  My son is very active and likes playing with a variety of toys and things.  However, from day 1, my son was just not interested in it.  He will play with it for a few seconds and move on to something more interesting to him.  The toy itself is a great idea and well made but it didn't work for us.",3
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"My daughter enjoys the crackle sound of the butterfly wings, the black/white contrast of back side of wings, and the bright colors on the front of the wings. She also likes to figure out how to pull the little chew piece out to put in her mouth. Bought this for her to be entertained on a plane ride to go visit family. Wish I would have bought it sooner for her. She was 9 months when I bought it and is still enjoying it in her 10th month.It says to wipe clean but I washed in washer machine and let air dry and the product came out clean and in good shape.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,This is my daughters new favorite. The toy is put together beautifully with bright colors and different textures on each wing.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"Both my babies have been enthralled with this friendly insect.  He's black and white on the back for the littlest ones, and the front has lots of parts that crinkle, squeak, and keep them busy.  The hook on top is great to clip it to the stroller as well.  A wonderful baby gift.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,My grandchildren love this toy. Especially my 5 month old. Very entertaining and easy to wash. Would recommend it to family.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"*** UPDATE APRIL 2011:  I have machined washed this several times (line dried) and it still looks brand new.  Nothing has torn off or faded.  Happy Happy Joy Joy!  ;)This is a visually beautiful and highly interactive rattle style toy.  My daughter did not really take to it until she was 3 months old, though -- don't think newborns are going to get much out of this.  She loves it now, however.  The only con (my opinion) is that this is a cloth toy that cannot be submerged in water.  It can only be surface wiped which I don't like for sanitary reasons... She is in teething mode and constantly putting it in her mouth.  That said, it is a very nice interactive toy with lots to look at, touch, shake, squeeze and pull.  The wings even make a crinkling/crackling noise somewhat similar to a potato chip bag.  Interesting little toy.",4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,Bought this for my 5 month old granddaughter. She loves all the colors and shapes. Very easy for her to grab and hold. Great toy!!,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"Great find for my grandbaby.  Love the color, texture, good quality, and it's nice and large.  She reaches for it every time she sees it.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,My grandaughter loves it and often plays with it.  It is helping her learn eye-hand coordination and she loves the crinkly wings.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,He attacks it while it's hanging in his Jungle Gym (Fisher Price). He goes to town on it! Didnt think he'd like it but he sure does :),5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,It was a much better price for this via amazon.  Toys R Us were outrageous.  It was deceiving how big it would be by the picture.  I didn't read the information.  So when I got it I was pleasantly surprised.  Nice quality and size was big.  Our grandson will enjoy this for many years to come.  Lamaze makes great products.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"When my daughter's house burned down, the one toy that needed to be replaced of all the toys my grandson received was this one!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,lots of things to capture childs interest.  squeaker makes my 7 month old smile every time and he loves chewing on the rings/tab and crinkling the wings.  bright and colorful and cute all over!,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,i got this for my 1 1/2 year old girl.  This toy is great and she likes it.  its color full with all the different colors. it was a good buy.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"This firefly is great, it has bright colors, different patterns and textures, rings, mirrors and makes a squeeky noise.",4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"My granddaughter loved this toy from the start, when she was first born. It stopped her from crying at a diaper change. She has it attached to her car seat",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,I got this for a baby shower gift.  My niece loved it.  It was very colorful and I think the baby will enjoy it.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,The quality is so bad that I suspect it is fake. I will not let my baby play with it.,1
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"I didn't expect that my son would like it so much when I received it as a gift. Babies start catching from red things, so these red and orange rings are exactly what is needed. It took for my son only one day to pay interest and try to grab it in age of 8 weeks. He is now only 12 weeks old, so he couldn't enjoy all the features of this toy. He likes staring at black/white patterns, playing with teether. My best part is squeakier, it helps us to stop crying of our baby.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"This toy is a lot bigger than I thought!  Great for baby's lil hands. Lots to do with it, you can hang it so baby can reach for it.",4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,I bought this for my grandaughter and she loves this toy colorful and enjoyable she plays with it all the time this was a great buy.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,This is a great toy with lots of funny textures to touch (and chew on!)Lamaze Freddie the Firefly became even more popular when Emma's manual desterity allowed her to get a better grip on him. That funny ""rustling"" sound he makes is a hoot!This toy is very well designed to hold a baby's attention and stimulate play!,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"I received this from my registry and hung it over the baby's changing table from day one.He never paid it much attention, or so I thought, at first.Until he was 4mos we left it hanging there until one day I saw him looking at it very purposefully. I'd previously wiggled it from time to time for him, but his eyes would wander after a minute or two.The day he 'looked' at it, I took it down and his eyes got so wide like he couldn't believe it was possible for this thing to come nearer.He shoved the face in his mouth.Now it's part of his regular rotation of slobber objects. He loves the face for mawing on and likes the thin wings for gumming. He's also totally into grabbing the red bug and the rings.I'm sure any one of the Lamaze toys could be just as loved, but this is the one we happen to have.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,its a nice toy my baby likes it but it doesnt make enough noise ! but she likes the colors,4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"I purchased this when i was still pregnant with my baby girl who is now 4 months old. I gave it to her pretty early, at around 2months of age, and I must say she took on the toy immediately. She constantly gazes at it and we noticed that she is very focused when staring at Freddie at that age. Now at 4 months, it's her favorite toy and keeps on ""talking"" to Freddie whenever she sees her, sometimes even when she's sleepy (my husband and I jokes that she's saying goodnight to him:)our friend also has a baby girl who visits our house almost everyday and there's a ""baby talk"" marathon when we lay them side by side with Freddie hanging nearby... it's just a blast to watch them so! for the price I paid for Freddie, I'd say it's so reasonable compared to the playtime we enjoy just by watching her interact with Freddie this way. :)",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,This item was shipped from China. It is of poor quality and definitely not a Lamaze original. Do not buy. And if you have bought it already and got the version this current seller is providing you NEED to report it to Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/reports to get them to ban this seller and prevent people's children from getting hurt.,1
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"What a beautiful and functional baby toy.  There are many different textures on this baby toy for your little one to feel.  There are holes, soft fabric, a squeaky, a teether, corduroy fabric, knots and a little mirror- what more could you ask for?",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"If you are looking for a gift for a friend's new baby, or one for your own baby this is the best toy ever!

Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"This is one of my 14 week old daughters first toys, I bought it for her before she was really grasping at things and all she could do was look at it. Now that she is able to grasp at things she loves Freddie the firefly! I think she enjoys the crinkle sounds he makes as well as slobbering all over his wings. I take this wherever we go!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,I bought this to go along with the play mat I bought and sent to my grandson. My son sent me a picture with my grandson lying on the play mat and playing with Freddie the Firefly which was hanging from the play mat.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,My baby is 2 months old and really likes to look at this toy. I hung it from his play mat and he just stares and coos at it.  So cute!,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"very colorful, many textures, and lots of fun elements in this toy.  at least 15 minutes of focused fun for baby.  my little girl loved it from the first moment it came out of the box.  I had to wrestle it away to remove the tags.  It is bigger than I realized, but that turned out to be a great thing.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,My daughter LOVES this toy.  My husband and I bought it for her when she was about 3.5 months old and she's been playing with it ever since.  There are so many textures and sounds for her to explore.  We hung it on an overhead toy bar and she just lays underneath it and bats at the wings so they make a crinkle noise. Freddie Firefly keeps her entertained for long periods of time.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,My little one liked this for a few monthes but bored of it quickly. It is still nice and seems well put together. Wish it had more organic materials though. Wouldn't buy again.,4

Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,Freddie is one of my daughters favorite toys.  It has a great shape so when she was younger it was easy for her to hold and manipulate the toy.  Now she is 8 months old she is facinated by the antennae.  A great toy for both younger and older babies.,5

Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"I purchased this toy for a ""santa"" gift for my 1 month old. I thought she would be to young for it but we didnt want our 4 year old asking questions about why Santa didnt leave the baby a gift. First off this toy is so cute! It is very bright and the fabrics are just great. I am also impressed that this toy is a decent size. It is actually pretty large which I prefer. It hooks easily to her play mat and to her car seat. It has great textures along with the colors and the crinkle noises, squeaks, rattles ect. Anyways, we took it out of the box and showed it to the baby and she sat there staring at it. She wouldturn her head to look at it even. I know they say babies cant see color until 4 months or so but she was facinated with this toy all the same. In fact we thought it was so great we also ordered the Lamaze Peacock and Mermaid to give her later! If you are looking for a great toy that will last your little one from infant on up this is it!",5

Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"My daughter LOVES Freddie and has since she was quite young (maybe 3 months).  We received this as a gift off our registry and it has gone everywhere with us (up until now, 9 months).  I imagine we'll continue to use it.  The colors and activities on it are great.  The size seems perfect for an infant (being larger then your standard car seat toy).  We travel in the car frequently and Freddie has been a great companion keeping the baby busy for hours of each trip.  This toy can be hung from a infant car seat handle, attached to a stroller or highchair, or played with alone.  We often hung it from our playmat to supplement the toys it came with.  And, best of all, Freddie always puts a smile on a grumpy face!  Your child will definitely love this toy!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"This is my little girls favorite toy. So many textures, colors and shapes for her to play with. Great for little kids.",5

Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"There are so many different ""hidden"" treasures on this toy.  I didn't even notice the embroidered ladybug under one of the wings until a couple months of Sofia using the toy.  She loves, loves, loves this one... even though she didn't get really interested in it until about 3 months of age.  She is now 5 1/2 months and still loves to play with this.Her favorite part about this toy is the crinkle noise it makes, so we have bought many, many other crinkle toys.  Still, this is her favorite.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,my daughter absolutely loves this toy. She's just learning to grasp objects and loves the crinkle sound this toy makes. I love that it's big enough for her to interact with and is visually stimulating.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"My daughter continues to love this toy at 4 months. When she was a newborn, she took notice of this toy because of the black and white patterns on the back of his wings. It was actually the only toy that seemed to attract her attention at such a young age. Well, at about 2-3 months, she was able to reach out and grab the wings and little arms. I found it fascinating to watch her curl her little fingers around all the different parts. I thought by now she'd be bored of it, but I was wrong. Now at 4 months she's grabbing the rings and teether and putting them in her mouth. She also loves when I squeak the squeaky toy.I highly recommend this toy because it seems to captivate babies at many ages. Just a note, it is quite large and doesn't hang well from my Graco Tour Infant seat (blocks her whole face). However, it attaches very well to her bouncy seat!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"I thought this is a good design, has multiple parts with different purpose.  But in fact, my baby only plays with the rings, not much other parts of the Firefly.",3

Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"I don't think this seller is selling genuine Lamaze toys. Stitching was unravelling around labels and materials just seemed &#34;off&#34; , seemed slightly grubby and not like usual Lamaze toys. will not use as I am worried that unsafe materials were used as my daughter is at the age where everything goes into her mouth.",1
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"Makes that fun crinkly noise and keeps baby happy! I like the double rings so he can easily be attached wi rings or a sippy grip. But otherwise he is just another baby toy, nothing fancy.",4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"We received Freddie as a baby gift. At first I kinda thought he was just a cute, but tacky useless stuffed animal. Boy was I WRONG! My son (who is now 4 months old) has been obsessed with him for months now. When he was tiny he loved to just stare at him. Freddie's back is done in big white and black print which dear son could stare at forever. When he started holding things it was easy for him to hold because Freddie has big, but flat wings and it was hard for him to drop him. Now he loves hearing Freddie crinkle, looking at the mirror, chewing on the lady bug in his pocket, and grabbing his rings. Freddie does have a small squeaker that isn't too annoying and is semi hidden so only my husband and I push it when wanted. It'll be a little bit before the baby can grasp squeaking it on purpose. And even then it's not loud and obnoxious like lots of baby toys.Freddie is by far our favorite baby item. We've accidentally left him at home once and that was a BIG.MISTAKE. This toy is now my ""go-to baby shower gift"" for all moms. He's FANTASTIC.",5

Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,My baby started staring at this toy as a newborn.  He only paid attention to the black and white side.  Now at 4 months he loves the colorful side.  He smiles whenever I bring it out and now grabs at it and trys to get it in his mouth.  He likes it much more than Mortimer the moose.  Freddy keeps his attention for about 20+ mins at a time which for us is pretty long!,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,I bought it for my 5 month old and he loves playing with it. The colors are bright and there's a squeaky sound he likes when i push on one of the wings.,4

Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,We got this as a gift and I just set it aside thinking my daughter wouldn't like it since it's so bulky.  At about 3 months she started to grab thing and I thought for sure she wasn't ready for this toy since her hands are so small.  Lo and behold she started playing with it and she loves it.  She likes to grab on to those two rings on the bottom and bite on that plastic hanging red lady bug thing.  She also likes the sound of the wings that makes a crinkly crunch noise.  It's also great because it has the hook on top so you can put it on the carseat or any jungle gym.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"My son LOVES this toy! There's so much for him to squeeze and chew on. If he doesn't have it, he's just not happy!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"Just bought this about 3 weeks ago, and this has been my three month old daughter's favorite toy.... she LOVES this thing!  He is just long enough to dangle from things so that she can grasp onto him.  Freddie also is very colorful and he makes the crinkly sound when she kicks or bats at him.  I would definitely suggest this toy!  My sister is about to purchase this for her 5 month old.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"My 5 month old son loves this but with a week or so the red thing that hangs down came loose and could have choked him to death.  Other than that, good product.",3
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"This is a wonderful, inexpensive toy for an infant. It is brightly colored, to capture the child's interest, and has a mirror and squeakie noise to keep the child entertained. It also has a hard ring for the child to grab or chew on, while overall the toy is soft and huggable. I generally give one of the toys from this family along with a Baby Deedee sleep nest whenever I need a baby gift. Parents always seem very happy to receive them.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"Freddie is a really fun toy, however, he is somewhat large. I wasn't expecting him to be quite so large. He has a lot of fun textures to his wings and the back of his wings have a black and white pattern which is quite stiulating to little ones. He is really a great toy for a 9-12 mos old or older and can easily fasten to the stroller or car seat. I think my grandson will love him when he gets a little older.",3
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"Our 5 month old loves this firefly.  It's easier for her to hold this one than the Peacock, which we also have and love.  She can get her arms around this one and we use this every time she gets in the car seat for a car ride.  She ceases to get tired of this.  Loves the crackly wings and rings.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"we love freddie and so does my daughter. she's had it since she was about 4 months old and is now 18 months. we keep it around just because, and she still plays with him every once in a while. it went everywhere with her when she was still an infant and she loved to stare at him.",3

Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"Our 6 month old has been playing with this toy since he was about 1 month - 6 weeks old and he loves it. We have two of them now - duplicate gifts from shower - but this is not a problem. One lives in the crib/goes on trips and one lives on the changing table. It's great to distract him while changing his diaper. He loves the textures, the different sounds and colors, and the rings to chew and pull on. I have enjoyed watching him develop his motor skills. I am pleased with all Lamaze toys, but this one is our favorite.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,This is a great toy. The only reason for four stars was it was sent directly from China and took a long time getting here even though I have premier service.,4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,Baby chucked it out. Never seen him play with this. Confounding for parents too. I would recommend to skip this one.,1
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"My son loved this toy from 4 to 6 months. Now at 7 months, he's lost interest in it and moved onto some of his other toys. But, for that 2 month period, this toy was attached to his carseat and he played with it constantly.. especially that red plastic teether. I threw this toy in the washer and dryer every week to wash and it has kept its shape and color nicely.",4

Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"This is the first toy that I bought for my child. I am a keen mother. So, I was very picky on what toy would first be submitted to my child. This firefly toy of Lamaze is a great decision that I had made.This is a good take along toy that could provide my child the stimulation and fun that he could possibly have. It has this huge big eye that could take the attention of my kid whenever he cries. The colors are also so vibrant that it could stimulate the vision of my child, as the doctors may say.It has been the constant companion of my child; it could cheer him up whenever he's crying and it would always give fun and enjoyment in his eyes.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"This is a wonderful toy for babies. I've purchased similar toys for baby gifts but am very impressed with this brand. There are so many bright-colored aspects on Freddie, as well as a variety of things to chew on, to pull on, to look at, and to hang on to. The description was very accurate!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,This is a fun excellent toy for little ones. I have 2 girls and he was used with both of them. Both of them loved their bugs! Freddie has so many things to grab their attention. He also makes fun rustling and rattling sounds ~ and has lots of things for baby to eat! The mirror on the wing is a great addition! I've bought several Lamaze toys for my girls and this was the most popular by far!,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,Bought this as a gift attachment but easily could have been a great gift all by itself.  It was bigger than I expected.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"I have purchased the butterfly, caterpillar, knight, etc. and none of them disappoint! Lamaze brand products are not only developmentally appropriate, but made very well. Over all quality is exceptional!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,My baby is now 6 months old and he loves to chew this toy :) Bright colors and crackle sounds make this toy a nice addition to your baby's development things.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,I was very disappointed in this.  It had a musty smell and came in a cellophane bag with no instructions on the purpose of this toy.  I'm an easily pleased person but I plan on returning this. Couldn't imagine giving this as a gift,2
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,I really like this toy.  It has lots of noises for the baby to explore and it is very attractive for babies.  I would recommend it for others.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"I had high expectations for this toy but my son has taught me otherwise. He likes the toy, but it's not a favorite as much as I try to bring it everywhere to get him used to it. The best feature for my boy, are the crinkle wings. I place this toy in his crib so when he kicks, the crinkle makes noise, and he loves the sound of that. So it keeps him entertained for a while.  I also place it on his bouncy seat as well near his feet, so he can kick and hear the crinkle.  ...as I write this review, my son is 6 months and has had this toy since 4 months. Maybe as he grows, he'll enjoy it more...?",4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,My daughter has spent many hours just staring and grabbing at this dragonfly! :)She absolutely loves him. She is four months as of yet and can grab here and there but she is still discovering things about this little guy.,4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"Purchased this for my 2nd baby girl. She loves it! The bright color, study fabric and the different options are so attractive to babies.

Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"Bright, colorful and soft are the key words to describe this baby toy. The toy was larger than expected but still works when hung on the mobile.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"This toy is fun for a baby and for a young toddler. One side is black and white and the other side is very colorful filled with fun fabrics, mirror and a pocket. Each wind has a different texture, it crinkles and fun to touch. My daughter enjoyed this toy since she was a few months old and until she was 2.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"My daughter loves this toy! I put it on her bouncy seat toy bar when she was 3 months, with the black and white side facing her for the contrast. Once she started using her hands, she found the rings and loved pulling on them and wearing them as bracelets! Then when she started teething, the ladybug became her favorite. Now she enjoys the colorful side, and I think this will be a toy that is preferred for months to come!!!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"Good day, sirs for the package can be seen that it does not emit any sound when pressing the button toy Wing",1

Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,I really like Freddie. I expected it to be bigger but the size is just right for baby. Haven't tried it out yet (2 more months til baby arrives) but know from my sister's experience that lamaze toys are wonderful. Be aware that the freddie you receive may be slightly different colors (similar though) than the pictured one.,4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,I bought the firefly and the peacock toy for my twins and they loved them.They were larger than I thought they would be which was fine because my girls were able to play with them longer as they got older. This toy was very well made.I had to put it in the wash quite a bit and they held up fine. My labrador got a hold of them to play with and they held up to the test. The toys have a lot of interactive items on them which kept my girls entertained alot. When I ran errands these were the toys I took because I knew they would entertain them the longest. I loved these toys so much that I just ordered Freddie the firefly for my friend who is pregnant.,5

Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"My 4 month old was sick with a cold, he usually cried in the car, this day was no different, he cried all the way to the doctors and then all the way from the doctors to the post office. I unpacked Freddie the Firefly and gave him to my son before I got back in the car. The only noise made all the way home and generally to this day a month later is the crinkle crinkle of Freddie!! The reviews were right, thanks Amazon!!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,its a little taller than an average palm. and was an instant hit with my new born and 20 month Old .,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,I bought this for my baby 4 years ago and she was obsessed with it for so long! I now buy it for every new baby in out lives.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"Do care the product from baby tree. I bought a &#34;Lamaze Play & Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy&#34; but I found maybe it's not the real item I need that is really made by Lamaze.Because my product was delivered from Jinhua,Zhejiang Province,China. With doubt,I compare it with my other Lamaze toys made by TOMY sold by Amazon,but found that it came without a cute instruction fasterned to the wing which you can find from the real one.And the package of other Lamaze toys made by TOMY prints instruction about &#34;Keep away the bags from baby&#34; in several language.I'm a father from China, I knew many simalar toys which maybe has the same appearance is sold for a quarter price of origin.We knew what the price is different.I will prevent my little daughter from biting the toys. After all,it looks the same and still will appreciate my daughter.",3
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,Gift recipent liked it. But will the baby like it. That is the question. Will let you know.. I'm a little concerned that it was made in China..,4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,It was as it is shown in the pics. Loved it. Thanks a lot to the seller. Must appreciate both the product and seller.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,My daughter was 9 months old when we got this and she loves this. We had to get her her own because she kept trying to take her baby cousins who is 6 months younger than her,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,This is my grand daughters favorite toy! As soon as she sees it her eyes light up and she starts kicking her feet. When she gets it she squeezes and bites on it. Too cute.!,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"I bought this toy for my daughter right after she turned 3 months old.  She adores this toy, and ""coos"" whenever she plays with it.  She hasn't figured out how to make it squeak yet, but she likes the crinkly wings and she rubs her hands over the different textures.The clip is very handy.  I attach this to her Tiny Love play mat, to her stroller, etc.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"My 12 week old baby loves freddie the firefly. There is so much going on that she never gets bored of it, she loves the crinkle wings and the mirror on the wing. SHe enjoys exploring all the different textures, sounds and colors on this toy. Highly recommend this for every baby",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"We received Freddie as a baby shower present.  I almost returned him because he was so much bigger in size than most other hanging toys and I couldn't imagine ever actually clipping this to her car seat.  I am so glad I never got around to it.  My daughter LOVES Freddie!I never did end up putting him on her car seat, or hanging him from anything for that matter.  However, for the past 9 months Freddie has been played with in some way or another nearly every day.  At first I would just prop him up nearby during diaper changes, and she would stare and stare at him.  When she was able to grab and hold on to things she would hold him and feel all the different textures on his wings, and played with the rings at the bottom.  A little older and she started chewing on the top 'hanging' ring.  She never really chewed on the actual teether much though.  A little older and she would crawl to get Freddie, and would pick him out of a basket of toys, so I can tell she actually likes him by choice, not because it's what I happen to hand to her.  Now she likes to give Freddie 'kisses' - basically eating his face off.Which brings me to another great thing about Freddie...  It says to spot clean, but I throw him right in the washer on the gentle cycle and hang him up to dry.  He's survived being spit up on and drooled on and dropped in the dirt camping, and every time he comes out looking brand new.  It hasn't ruined the squeaker or the crinkle sound either, both of which she loves.As she gets a little older maybe we'll use Freddie to learn colors and simple words, we'll see...  But even if she stopped playing with him today (which I doubt, since she knows Freddie by name now...), Freddie is definitely well worth the money because we've already gotten 9 great months of use out of him.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,This butterfly is very colorful. It has lots of different items to stimulate sound on it.  It has many ways for an infant to hold it.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,This is a pretty cool toy...my daughter loves it. In fact she hates traveling in the car but this toy keeps her occupied for sometime. It has many interesting facets.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"I did not read the spec when I bought this toy, I thought it would be a regular size toy. To my surprise this and other toys I bought was a nice size and nicely made.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"Freddie was awesome until the dog found it. Best dog toy of all time. Freddie squeaks, crinkles, and gets torn to shreds in mere seconds. I am sure this is totally unsafe as a dog toy, but tell that to my dog.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"Perfect first toy for my baby boy. He grabs on to it all the time. It has quickly become his favorite. It is a cute looking toy, very colorful. It has lots of small details. So it retains his attention for a while. The noise it makes is fun for babies and not irritating for us.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"freddy is AWESOME. my son loves this little guy. one of his favorite toys to gnaw at. sometimes he just stares at the black and white patterns on the back of freddy's wings. nowadays he's into the red teething plastic. when we take freddy out, other little kids/babies come and try to snatch him away from our baby. freddy just attracts babies like crazy! luv luv luv this product",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"My 6 month old son loves this toy... he has loved it ever since he was a small baby. The only downside - I wish it were machine washable, considering the amount of time it spends in my son's mouth!",4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"I've given this to so many babies.  So colorful with many textures and a great crackly sound on one wing.  After the 1st grandchild got tired of it, we put it away for a few months several times and she played with it in different ways through her 3rd or 4th year.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"A friend recommended this toy because my 4mo. old had little or no interest in any toys. Well she just loves it and we call it her ""bff"", she never gets bored with it. I plan to try out more Lamaze toys!",5

Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,Bought this for my grandaughter who is  3 1/2 months old.  Was very happy with it and she reacted well to it.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"My baby absolutely LOVES Freddie the Firefly.  She likes it during tummy time (and she never used to like tummy time at all) and she loves it attached to her baby gym.  What I love is that there is a wide variety of extra brightly colored bits and pieces that catch Baby's eye but are not well pictured in the photograph on the website.  Not only are there bits of mirror but the wings crinkle and make noise, a bell tinkles inside the firefly, a little ladybug is embroidered on one wing and repeated in plastic on a little loop on the other side.  Plus it has a snap ring on the head and another two on the end of the tail, meaning I can snap Freddie in two places on Baby's gym so it ""flies"" over her.  Would definitely purchase again!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"This is my infant's favorite toy by far. it is easy for her to hold, manipulate, and she loves the different textures and crinkle noises the wings make (this is why we call him &#34;Mr. Crinkley&#34;)Highly recommended.",5

Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"I actually purchased one of these locally, but given how easily babies tend to lose/ruin things, and how much my son adores his butterfly, I went ahead and purchased 2 extras on Amazon. **I never leave home with out it.** That said, it's held up to months of use pretty well, and I have zero complaints about it.Holding the butterfly about a foot away and shaking it so the wings flap is just hilarious to him. One of the first times I've ever heard him giggle about something.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,This is a great toy for little babies. There are so many opportunities for stimulation with great colors. The mirror is fun as you lift and close it which makes for great fun as the baby develops. There are also many sounds as you touch various parts of the wings.This is my grandaughter's favorite toy.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,Bought this for 4 month old grandchild for Christmas because it was cute and colorful.  Hope she likes it when she's old enough to play with it.  I was satisfied with the quality if this toy.,5

Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"Warning! Do not purchase this toy. My child has gotten her ankle and arm stuck in the rings of this toy. If I wasn't present, this toy would have stopped blood flow. There are many other toys out there that are much better and SAFE! Pass on this one!!!!!!",1
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"I bought this based on the good quality and bright colors of the Lamaze Peackock which is perfect for my 6 months boy. I incorrectly assumed Lamaze products were of high quality, I was wrong, this lacks of bright color, looks like a fake, I have seen other buyers pictures and there is no way the product I received is the same, bad for me I had this brought to my country by a friend of mine. Check the pictures I uploaded, I will never buy lamaze again",1

Lamaze Play &amp; Grow My Friend Emily Take Along Toy,"We got this as a gift when my daughter was 3 months old and she loved it right away. Her interest has gone down now that she's 7 months, and I'm not sure why. I wish this doll had more of a teething feature like Freddie firefly. Still a cute doll, though.",4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow My Friend Emily Take Along Toy,I received this doll as a gift when my daughter was born.  She is now 4 months old and absolutely loves the Emily doll! She loves the crinkle sound of her dress and the two rings that come with it.  It attaches to the car seat and stroller which make it a lifesaver on car trips.  The bright colors and different textures make this doll a great learning tool for baby! I highly recommend it!,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow My Friend Emily Take Along Toy,Emily is deinfitely a freind to my three month old. She seems to be somewhat of a high strung baby. She fights with emily!!! But Emily keeps her occupied for a while. It's just that for some reason she gets so frustrated when playing with toys that I eventually have to take emily away for her own sake but Emily is a great toy.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow My Friend Emily Take Along Toy,My daughter is 6 months old and this is her absolutely favorite toy. She will play with it for 30-45 minutes at a time and just loves it. Best baby toy i've purchased.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow My Friend Emily Take Along Toy,This was a gift for a 1yr old.  She really liked the  &#34;crinkly&#34; skirt bottom. Exceeded what I thought I would get.,4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow My Friend Emily Take Along Toy,"I bought this for my five-month-old daughter and she seems to like it.  The rings on the doll's hand are easy for her to grasp, and as with anything that goes in my daughter's hands, she puts it directly to her mouth to gnaw on it.  This doll is bigger than I anticipated, which is great, as is the bright color scheme.  The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five, is because the doll's entire dress is lined with loud crinkly material.  It sometimes startles my daughter!  I think it would be more appealing if just the hem was crinkly, but we still love this toy.",4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow My Friend Emily Take Along Toy,Got this for my cousins new baby.... her name is &#34;emily&#34;. She comes form a family of redheads. What better?,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow My Friend Emily Take Along Toy,"a great toy for new born babies, has lot of stuffs in this small toy. the sound it makes is a lil irritating but i guess thats what attract babies.. :)",4
Fisher-Price Power-Plus Plug-In Swing - Best Friends,"Sometimes using this swing was the only way we could get our son to sleep.  This one plugs in so you don't go through a bunch of batteries.  Also it has a small footprint so you won't be wasting valuable floor space.  Would be nice if it swung from side to side.  Babies tend to prefer that motion.  TheFisher-Price Baby Papasan Cradle Swing version has that motion, but is more expensive and takes up a ton of space.",3
Fisher-Price Power-Plus Plug-In Swing - Best Friends,"Unlike some of the other reviewers, we haven't had any problems with this swing at all; in fact, it has worked very well. I love that it plugs in, and I actually chose it for the ""drab"" colors, as ours sits in the living room and not the nursery. It's a bit classier looking than its garish primary-colored cousins. One reviewer mentioned that the tray gets in the way, but it snaps off and on very easily.  The mobile swings back out of the way, as well, so it's very easy to get baby in and out.There are two things I would probably change about this swing, but neither is a major concern for us. First, there isn't a noticeable difference among the six speeds, at least not on ours. The one speed it has, though, is perfect for calming our baby, so I really can't complain. Secondly, the music really grates on my nerves. The sound of it is cheap and cheesey, and even on the lower volume setting it seems much too loud for being as close to the baby's head as it is. But the music can be turned off, so again, this doesn't prevent us from enjoying the swing.All in all, I would recommend this product, especially if you prefer simple and understated baby gear. Our 2-month-old loves it.",4
Fisher-Price Power-Plus Plug-In Swing - Best Friends,"It took me about 10-15 minutes to assemble, and it works great so far. I don't know what others are talking about, that it doesn't swing hard/fast enough, it seems to be just fine. Plus the plug in feature is PHENOMINAL. Honestly the mobile is really cheap and when the swing is on it shakes back and forth violently, lol. I just took it off completely since it annoys me...",4
Fisher-Price Power-Plus Plug-In Swing - Best Friends,"I bought this swing and my baby loved it and the music, but a month after I purchased it the music stopped working.  The manufacter was very good about addressing a refund and sending out prepaid postage labels for the defective product, but as I just sent it back I don't know how long the actual refund process takes.  I loved being able to plug the swing in, and the pockets on the sides for toys and such.  But, the seat does not recline far enough for the baby to fall asleep comfortably.  I have a big baby(16 lbs at 2months) and it seemed to swing well enough for the up to 25 lbs. rating. I didn't really think the speed settings actually adjusted the speed. I ended up buying the Graco lovein' Hug to replace this swingGraco Lovin Hug Easy Entry Open Top/Curved Frame Swing in Bancroft, but the Margo color.  It is great and I like it so much better.  It has a five point harness, the baby can recline more and in a more comfortable seat, it swings great even with my little one now weighing over 20 lbs., and I like the settings better.  He seems so much more comfortable in the Graco swing.",3
Fisher-Price Power-Plus Plug-In Swing - Best Friends,Excellent swing for the main reason that it plugs in and doesn't cost you hundreds of dollars in batteries like some others on the market.,5
Fisher-Price Power-Plus Plug-In Swing - Best Friends,overall i love this swing but my son is 16lbs and if i put him in there with a blanket on his legs it slows way down i put it on the highest setting anything else and it hardly moves. the volume is very loud or so low you can hardly hear it. and the three seat positions are not that great it dosnt go back far enuff and the mobile is kinda outa sight with the way the seat reclines but other than that i love it and not having to buy batteries is great,3
Fisher-Price Power-Plus Plug-In Swing - Best Friends,"I bought this because of the plug-in feature.  I have theGraco Lovin Hug Easy Entry Open Top/Curved Frame Swingthat I like much better.  This Fisher Price swing is very slow even on the highest setting and if a blanket falls and touches the ground, it stops the swing completely!  It also has a post between the baby's legs and it doesn't recline very far, so it isn't great for having the baby nap in.  The seat itself is not very large - my two month old's legs are already sticking off of it.  It was only $80 here, so I didn't waste my money, but if Graco made a plug-in swing, I would surely get that instead.  I have an older Fisher Price swing with similar styling and I like the Graco much better than both of them!",3
Fisher-Price Power-Plus Plug-In Swing - Best Friends,"i bought this because it was a good price on amazon and also because it uses an adaptor and i wanted to save on batteries. plus it is supposed to be used with babies up to 30 pounds. the fact that it had a plug was number one. well i am disapointed because it has six speeds and it hardly moves. it swings back and forth very little and somewhat fast  rather than like a wonderful battery powered swing i had years ago that had six speeds and and you could see the difference in each speed, even with heavier babies. its like it swung slower but higher like a real swing. this swing has no power in the swing, its a weak little back and forth like motion...six speeds? what a joke.and it doesnt recline enough for a newborn or young baby. also the colors of the little animals hanging overhead is quite boring. however looking at a lot of the swings...most of them have very little strength in the swing. meaning its just a little sad back and forth movement that is on the fast side....not a slow controlled back forth movement with a good sized distace from back and forth position.big disapointment. they need to work on this one and then they will have a winner.",2
Fisher-Price Power-Plus Plug-In Swing - Best Friends,"I bought this for my son when he was about a month old.  When he reached about 15 pounds, the swing kept stopping swinging...I returned twice andboth replacements had the same problem.  I used it anyway, even though it would often stop swinging, and when my son was old enough to move his head and lean over, his head banged on the metal railing holding the swing.  I called Fisher Price and I am shocked to see that they have not recalled this product, it is downright dangerous!",1
Smart Stages 3-in-1 Rocker Swing,"My baby is 2 mos. old. Not a bad swing. I like that it will convert to a rocking chair for my daughter's room when she's bigger. Lifts out VERY easily for use as a baby chair (no buttons to push or anything. Just lifts out). I imagine this will be much more useful when she's eating. Right now, I use a different baby chair that lays back more. If your baby is newborn, he/she will likely fall forward as it swings. My daughter did, even on the lowest setting. You'll need to STRAP BABY IN and use a rolled up receiving blanket to support baby's head in this swing (placed in an upside down ""U"" shape around the head). This is because it does not lay back very far. Now that my daughter is 2 mos. old, she doesn't fall forward in it anymore. My only real complaint is the music. It's mechanical and ""tinny"" sounding, and repeats the same few songs over and over. I would've liked more song  choices. She gets bored with it. I just play jazz for her on the radio that is near the swing, and I leave the swing music off all together.She likes this swing, and even falls asleep in it from time to time. If you have a large breed dog - keep an eye on baby in this swing. Our Lab  thinks that as soon as we put baby in this swing - it means she can lick my daughter all over the face. LOL. Perfect height for her to be face to face with baby. I'm sure that would be true of ANY swing (except those you can put on a table).UPDATE- When it came time to transform the swing into a chair for our daughter, she loved it! Still uses it today, and she's 2 yrs. old now.",3
Smart Stages 3-in-1 Rocker Swing,"very helpful, my infant relax in it, and has a good period of nap..But I recommended for babies over six months of age.",5
Soothe 'N Play Safari Bouncer,"I wish I'd found this sooner! I saw a few photos of this in other mommies' kid pictures and I had to have it. The fabric and colors are adorable. And so are the toy animals. My 4 month old daughter loves to sit in it and grab the animals. The elephants have crinkly ears and the lion has pretty ribbons in his mane. We haven't used the vibration option yet but will try it out soon. I just love this bouncer, and hope she doesn't outgrow it too fast!",5
Soothe 'N Play Safari Bouncer,"My little boy loves it! He can sit in it for a while, fall asleep in it, play with the toys, and bounce. It gives me some free time since he enjoys it so much. I love how it looks. It is much cuter in person. I just love it! I'm glad I finally went with this one over the more expensive ones.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"I bought two of these and had to return both of them because they both were defective!  After a few days, they started making a terrible loud clicking sound when one of the parts moved up and down.  This product is a piece of junk.",1
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,We have two bouncers for our twins and I definitely prefer this one to the other one.  They are 11 weeks old now and are completely mesmerized by the moving parts.  I am very happy with my purchase and it runs for a long time on the batteries.  Would definitely recommend as a purchase!,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"I love this bouncy chair. My daughter was in it the day she was born up until she was 8 months old. She loved the toys and the water fall, she loved everything about it, when she got bigger she sat on the floor and played with the toys on the floor. Great for pictures and all! The only thing i didnt like was it didnt recline back very much for a sleeping newborn.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"As an exclusively pumping mom, my 2 month old spends a lot if time in this chair. The vibrations soothe her and she stares at the waterfall. The chair is sturdy and I can bounce it with my foot. We use a boppy head support with it bc I'm worried she'll get a flat spot.I think there are some kinks with this bouncer. I do hear a clicking every once and a while, and twice the activity bar seems to have shorted out. Both times that happened it worked fine the next day.UPDATE: The motor started clicking then the vibrations got lighter and lighter until they disappeared even with fresh batteries. I called Fisher Price about it on a Monday, and a new motor arrived on Thursday of the same week. The bouncer has a one year warranty, and it could not have been easier to get a new motor since I had already registered the product with them. I am changing my review to 5 stars bc the customer service was so great.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,I bought this for my 2 month old for christmas. My baby loves it. My baby will sit in it for hours.,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,Got second one for our soon to come nephew. The built is quite stable and baby loved the Good toys and nice music !,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,The Fisher-Price tradition of quality is evident in this bouncer.  Our baby loves it.  It's heavy duty and will last for generations.  I recommend this product highly.,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,My baby loves this seat. He has been using this everyday since he has been born.This product is so adorable!,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"We received this as a gift and although we still have yet to buy the 4D batteries to make it work, the seat itself is great. I like how you can remove the waterfall thing and it can just be a seat. She actually slept it in her first week of life because it's elevated and she had reflux. I can type online and bounce it with my foot. I think everyone should have a bouncy seat for their baby.",3
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"My 4 month old son loves this bouncer, he actully sleeps in this at night. This was my fav. thing intell about 30 min ago when i herd my son screaming and went in to find his foot stuck in the toy bird on the toy bar. His poor foot is black and blue.as much as he loved it i think i will have to stop useing it now.",3
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"My son is 10 weeks old and loves this thing! I put him in it after I feed him so I can eat myself and when I'm busy doing chores around the house this keeps him occupied. I'm pretty sure he would stay in it all day if I let him! The music is not overly annoying the I love the lights and how the little monkey and frog move about, my son loves those features. Everytime I put him down in this he smiles before I even turn it on! :)",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"I bought it before my baby was born. My baby didn't like it when I put him in it for the first few times before he was one month old. He started to like it when he was about 4 or 5 weeks old and since then he spent 20-30 minutes each time in it and about 2 hours each day. Bouncing has become a very important of his everyday routine. Every time after I feed and burp him, I put him in the bouncer. He is very happy in it. How do I know it? He coos and laughs loudly. This bouncer also serves an unexpected function: most of my baby's pooping is done in it.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"It's an improvement over an older model we had for our first child.  However, I still think Fisher Price should make it a little stronger.  Otherwise it's great, and we just learned to live the clicks. The price was right.  My local Sears had it for $19.99!",4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"I bought this bouncer for my neice for her new baby.  It is very colorful and strudy.  The toys click off and on, very easy.  Great service will purchase another one for the next baby shower that we are invited to.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"I purchased this product, thinking by now Fisher Price had fixed the broken toy bar.After one day it would only work on child play mode.....not on continuous play.I am so disappointed in Fisher Price. This same complaint has been going on since  2007.I would buy another bouncer,I do not recommend this one.I should have paid more attention to other complaints on the same problem.DO NOT BUY!!!!",1
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,I purchased this rainforest bouncer for my Granddaughter and she just loves it.  She sleeps in it plays in it and is constantly amused by all the animals. Great buy for new borns and they learn to amuse themselves.,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"My daughter enjoys this seat very much.  I read many of the reviews here before we purchased the seat and I was a little concerned.  I must say we have not had any problems and love the seat.  It is more upright than many others we considered which is great because my daughter loves to be upright and look around.  She enjoys the toys and can grasp them just fine.  The lights and music are great too.  She slept in this chair at night for the first few months of her life and at that age, she loved the vibration.  At this point, she is not sleeping in it but she still loves to use it during the day for a little playtime.  At 4mos old, she is huge (18lbs and 25"" long) but she still fits just fine.  The extra weight does make the chair not quite as upright but it is still holding up really well.  The cover is easy to remove, easy to wash and it air dries very quickly.  The batteries seem to last a long time.  My 2&1/2 year old can remove and reattach the play/light bar with ease...so it is easy to use.  Overall, we are very happy and would by this again.",4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"We got this for my daughter back on the 2nd of July when she was 2 months old because we needed somewhere to put her (besides the floor) when we went to my parents for a large 4th of July gathering.  She is still using it at almost 8 months, although not as much now since she is crawling and doesn't like sitting still as much.  However, this bouncer always kept her entertained for a long time, giving me time to do something else.  And, no clicking sound for us as of the time of this writing, even though our 3 year old has grabbed hold of the monkey and kept it from going up and down several times it hasn't broken and still works perfectly.  We've been happy with it.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,My son loves his Rainforest bouncer. It keeps him entertained for a long period of time. The bouncer has the option to let the sound run for several minutes or to react to him hitting the toys. The vibrate option calms him when he is fussy and he likes to sleep in it.,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"I use this bouncer all the time for my 2 month old son, this is my first child, at first he didn't care for the activity bar part, most likely because he's too young, but he's noticing it now and swatting at the parrot to make the lights and sounds go off.He'll sit quietly in this bouncer without the activity bar for up to an hour at a time, even with the vibration off. I don't know if he likes the vibration as there's no reaction from him whether it's on or off, he has fallen asleep with it on though so maybe he does like it?He loves to sit and watch the tv in the bouncer. I can bring it room to room which is great so I can get chores done, and keep an eye on him. I like that you can set it to only light up and play sounds when he makes it move.The only really negative thing to me about this bouncer is that the activity bar is difficult to pull out. My son can get really upset with it there, I've gone to remove it and have to pull so hard that one end came flying out and almost hit him, I think it should slide out easily once you have the clips pulled back to release it.",4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"I bought this from Amazon for my baby nephew, and he absolutely loves it.  His parents call it the ""Happy Fun Chair"", and not only is it great as a bouncer, it stimultes my nephew's sense of sound and sight.  It turned out to be a terrific gift, I'm glad other Amazon reviewers were able to steer me to the Rainforest Bouncer.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"We received this bouncer as a gift at our shower! We have used it since day 1. He wasn't interested in the toys at first but at about 2 1/2 months he really used it. He loved watching the waterfall, and especially the frog! We took the toy bar off at 4 1/2 months because he started crunching forward in it because he didn't want to be reclined anymore! He was 5 & 1/2 months when he decided he REALLY wanted to sit up and flipped it over! Thankfully my husband was there to catch it! We have moved to a Fisher Price Convertible Seat now but I really enjoyed the Rainforest Bouncy. My son is 6 month & 20 pounds so he really outgrew it fast! I will definitely use it for baby number 2!",4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"My baby girl LOOSES HER MIND in this thing. Her face lights up, she laughs, she wiggles around. Mesmerized. I recommend this without reservation. It's a ton of fun for your little one.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"I admit that I agreed with my son-in-law, at first, on the Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer - it seemed like it would not be particularly useful.  Then the little one arrived, and we both changed our minds.  This is definitely an essential piece of equipment for any little one - and an even more essential piece of equipment for the adults caring for the baby.Like all Fisher-Price products, this is a well made item.  The cloth seating area is nicely finished and the fabric is not cheap or scratchy.  If necessary, and it will be, the cover removes easily for washing.The seat can be inclined as the baby grows to allow for a more upright sitting position, although it does not incline enough for an fully uprighted seated position.  The incline feature is very useful if your little one suffers from reflux since keeping the baby upright, after feeding, for the 15 - 30 minutes your doctor may recommend can be tiring if the baby is large or it is o-dark-thirty at night.The incline is also nice because once your baby is a bit older and staying awake more, you can move the seat from room to room as you go about your daily life.  This allows the baby to observe different environments and allows you to explain your activities so that the baby's language learning can advance.We found the ""bouncy"" feature, actually a vibrating, very useful when the baby was fussy or when he was having difficulty going to sleep.  It was soothing and helped calm him down.The arched toy which can be attached and turned on is another very nice feature.  It does not ""go"" continually, but requires that the baby do something to activate the music, motion, or toys.  This is particularly nice if you are an individual who dislikes the continuous, automated music on some toys.  The colorful parts are eyecatching and stimulate your baby's visual sense.The Rainforest Bouncer is useful up to about 20 pounds.  At that point, the baby's weight is sufficient to prevent the upright position from being particularly useful.  Regardless, this is one piece of equipment that is essential for any parent or caregiver - it fills a number of useful functions, is well made, and is reasonably priced.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"We got this as a shower gift, so I thought it would sit in the closet for a while. Not so.  We used just the bouncer part right away.  It's just a normal bouncer seat that vibrates.  But when my baby turned 6 weeks old, we started attaching the entertainment console for a few minutes at a time.  He loves it!  An now, at 8 weeks, he ""talks"" to the monkey and the toucan every time we put it on.  Get ready to invest in batteries!",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"My little girl (almost 6mnths now) has enjoyed this from when she was just a few weeks old. First she enjoyed the calming vibrations and music. Then she wildly flailed her arms - sometimes hitting the monkey and parrot and delighting herself in the music that followed. Then she hit them on purpose, Then she moved on to closely srcuitinizing each, discovering the moving creatures at the top of the panel, the water fall and bouncing by herself.We love the product - allows us to get some chores done or mommy to have her meals. Yes, it was part of my registry - but I would gladly pay for it.My baby has been using this in combination with the activity mat and papsan swing and has been very happy.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"We love this seat. It is our baby's favorite place to be put down. He'll play with the toy bar, watch the lights and rainforest friends until he falls asleep. The 4 D batteries last a long time, but I still would recommend getting some good quality rechargeables for it.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"Our son loves this bouncer.  Other reviews say the toys hang too low, but I found that helpful when he was small.  He started hitting the bird and grabbing the rings the first week!  All the other toys we had were too far away for him.  Now that he's 9 weeks, he likes to watch the waterfall.  Be careful not to leave the sounds on the activate button if they fall asleep.  Sometimes he would kick the toys and the music would startle him when it turned on.  Only problem is that sometimes the vibrating makes a loud noise.",4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,This is the best bouncer we have had.  It's much better than others we have used because the rain effect and the animals moving is so entertaining that the baby watches it.,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,We bought this for my first daughter 2.5 years ago and she loved it. Now my second daughter (6m) uses it and absolutely loves it too! We have a couple other bouncers and both girls preferred the FP Rainforest one. Super happy with this product!!! The only bad thing is that it eats up batteries fairly quickly...and they are D's.,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"I had another bouncer (bouncenette from Safety 1st which was really a piece of junk so I ordered this based on the reviews)that is folded and will never be used again.Before ordering this one, I hesitated with another one. I picked the FP because the toy bar seemed more interactive and entertaining. The other one had good reviews too, seemed actually more comfortable, but the toys were only soft toys so I wasn't sure how much our daughter would be entertained by them.This one is a nice bouncer. Cute too.The waterfall stopped working (the lights and music were still working, just no more movement of the waterfall) and the monkey and frog next to the waterfall stopped moving after about a month of use. I called FP and they said they would send a replacement toy bar.When putting together, we had to bend the tubing that holds the seat and toy bar so that it would be straight (it was inclined towards the back, so pretty much in the baby's face). Also, the monkey and bird hanging from the bar are not that far high, my daughter (2m old) is kicking them with her knees. The seat isn't that far under the toy bar.It's a pretty good product for the price.",4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"As a father and grandfather, I have purchased countless chairs, walkers and bouncer type baby items.  I can say without reservation that this Rainforest Bouncer is the very BEST we have ever used.  The fabric is comfortable and easy to remove (for washing) and replace.  The vibrator feature provides just the right amount of stimulation for the child and the arch of toys and lights is fascinating to our grandson.  He smiles, giggles, laughs and reaches for the toys and lights whenever he sits in his bouncer.  We would buy this item again without hesitation.  In fact, we already have -- we bought a second one to keep in our house so that Mom and Dad don't have to transport the bouncer with them for visits.Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,This product looks difffent than in the picture. It has a missing hole for screw and a part is wrong ensambled.It looks cheap.,2
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"We have been using this bouncy seat since my baby was a week old (with the help of one of those head-rests you use for infant car seats at first) and he has loved it since the first day we put him in it! Since the waterfall lights up, it really catches the attention of even the littlest babies. My son's favorite is the frog that moves, it keeps him spellbound! At first I thought the toys were way too low, they hit my son's legs, but as he got older I realized they need to be that low so they can activate the music, motion and light all by themselves. This seat keeps him so occupied and happy, we still have not needed to use the vibration option on this! (we have others, a papasan and one other that we NEED the vibrations or he gets cranky and bored!)This seat is HIGHLY reccommended!",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"Used this for many months with my second child a couple of years ago. Overall, the product is good. It did the job. However, the plastic front and pieces are very hard and would bump my daughter on them sometimes when putting her in and out of it. Very cumbersome to take the parts on and off for going in and out of it multiple times. The water leaked out of the rainforest plastic piece and ended up throwing away. Now that I am expecting the next child, I am choosing a different bouncer seat this time around.",3
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"We bought this back in 2008 for our first child when I could no longer tolerate spending whole days with my baby on my hip. It was a lifesaver back then - I needed somewhere I could dump her while I hung up the washing or chopped an onion which would allow her to sit up a little, watch me and be jiggled about at the same time. The vibrations would soothe her while the horrible plastic toys and particularly the light-up waterfall would distract her and I would get approximately 20 mins to get stuff done before she lost interest and needed picking up again. It may not seem like much but that 20 minutes was GOLDEN. We're now on our third baby and once again it is proving to be a wonder tool. The bouncer is also occasionally wheeled out for visiting parents who are amazed by its capabilities to soothe and distract. Unlike other reviewers, I never found the music plastic toys (which, as other reviewers have pointed out, do hang to low down) the most compelling feature and neither did I much appreciate the garish jungle print, but the 'Vibrator' fast became one of a few absolute essentials I wouldn't not have done without. We actually left the 'bridge' attachment with its waterfall, monkey and parrot, off the chair for the second and third babies, preferring to place a toy arch in front of the chair and hang other toys off it.The only problem is that now, five years after we bought it and having seen us through three babies, the motor that makes it vibrate has worn out and it no longer jiggles. This is obviously a disappointment as it is for me the overwhelming clincher, but it is getting old and I would consider this lifespan for a small motor of this sort pretty average, good even. I'm hoping that I can find a Fisher Price spare parts supplier that will replace it for me.(N.B., if you're curious as to what else I rate as having that 'lifesaving' quality for coping with babies and toddlers, you could peek at my other reviews - yet to write but I plan to share my experiences)",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"We were looking for a Baby Shower gift but it was a discontinued item and was hard to find.  One, finding the correct gift and two,paying less for it was a pleasant surprise. We will use Amazon for those hard to find items.  Jim Douglas",4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,This toy was useless to us in the first couple months because I had better places for her to sleep and had a swing that she liked better.  She has never been a fan of the vibration.  What most concerns me is that this toy has made her cry more than once.  She starts to get all excited about the lights and music and waves her hands about.  Then her hand strikes the hanging toys which are quite sturdy and she cries.So we sent it back.It's really cute and might be good for calm babies but maybe not so good for excitable babies.,2
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"This has been a life saver.  My newborn wouldn't sleep and this made it happen.  The vibration made sleeping better for her and eased her colic.  Now that she is a few months old and sleeps in her crib with no problem, the removable toys are back on the seat and keep her entertained while I'm cooking or showering.  I would recommend this to anyone.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"Like many other reviewers our child loves the chair but, after about a week the gears of the Frog slip and begin making a loud clicking noise.  We took the sound and light bar back and exchanged it for another that broke in only two days.  On the new one, the music will not stay off after a few minutes it turns back on and wakes him up.I'd like to see Fisher Price add a strap to the underside of the seat to eliminate the rattle of the vibration box as they did on earlier seat as well.  All in all this is great idea poorly designed and poorly executed.  Fisher Price should replace it.",1
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,The product was delivered very fast with great price. The product is very useful for my daughter. We use this everyday.,4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,I recently purchased this for a friend of mine who had just had her first daughter.  While visiting her my 2 month old son tested it out and absolutely loved it!  He smiled and cooed everytime he was placed in it.  He loved it so much as soon as we returned home I ordered it for him.  It is such a big hit!,4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,My baby LOVES this.  She has played in it non stop since 5/6 weeks and she is 12 weeks now.  Great hand/eye coordination and colorful!!,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,my daughter loves this thing. Its cute and very fun for her to play with. She would lay in this thing nonestop! I think every mom should go with this out of all the bouncers out there!!,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"And I owe it all to this bouncer. I'd feed him, let him get sleepy, then strap him into the bouncer next to the shower. Between the vibrating chair and the white noise of the bathroom fan, he's sleep the entire shower, every time. Fisher-Price must have made some modifications to the product recently, because our bouncer looks a little different than the picture and many of the complaints of previous reviewers I haven't experienced. We've had no problems with the monkey making clicking noises (and we've used it heavily for 3 months now) and the toy bar doesn't seem too low - we have a pretty big little guy and they're not in his lap or anything. When he was a lot smaller he would sometimes hit the toys with his legs while kicking, but now that he's bigger his legs extend far past the toys and this isn't a problem anymore. Our monkey didn't come with rings, so they either redesigned that or we just got an incomplete unit - either way, I don't think they would have added much. The toy bar is easily removed should he become bored with it or it just gets in the way or something. At 13 weeks, he's just figured out how to control his hands and has taken and interest in toys. It's fun to watch him learn that he can bat the toucan or monkey and make the music and lights come on himself. The plastic unit that creates the vibration has been covered on the top and sides with the fabric from the seat cover, so no chafing on little legs. We use rechargeable batteries in this and they seem to last a long time even though we use it for an hour or so every day.  The other thing I like is that this bouncer is quite ""bouncy."" Some of the other ones on the market are stiff or don't bounce at all. If you're looking for a stationary seat that won't move much, this one isn't for you. And to address another reviewer's concern - it may look a little upright before you put your baby in it, but because it has so much give, their weight will cause it to recline. In fact, our baby lays pretty flat with just a small upward angle (maybe 20 degrees or so) now that he weighs 15 lbs. Overall, a good bouncer and it's served us well, though every kid is different and you'll need to decide what features you're looking for.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"This  is a  real beautiful bouncer.  Not noisy atall  and the lites and all the animals are just adorable!  Mine did not work well at first, but I called customer service and got a replacement OVERNITE!  Thank you.  My four months old has no problem with this, he approved, I'm happy!",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"It was a spontaneous buy I made for our son when he was ~3 months old and it proved to be a great buy! Our son loves to play with the monkey, frog, bird etc and enjoys the blue light falls. His fascination with this has not faded in spite he being ~11 months old now (i.e. 8 months of seeing this bouncer day in day out), which speaks to the creative / attractive design of Fisherprice. Couple of things I'm not impressed with: 1) the mechanism does make some noise as the monkey / frog moves up and down; 2) the vibration is not powerful enough to make baby sleep and 3) the price ~40 bucks is still too high relative to other competitive products in the market. But overall, I'd give it a solid rating. Recommended buy!",4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"I purchased this ""Bouncer"" for my Great-Grandson who is 6 mos. old. This is a quality product and a delightful rest area for babes. The lights, sounds, etc. all work well. In fact, I bought two of these for the other Great- Grandparent's home when he visits them. The ONLY negative point I may make is that the battery compartment is difficult to get to, and the screws that hold the battery compartment cover eat into the plastic, so I fear that the cover will not last long after changing the batteries a few times.. But hey...I can always TAPE it closed!",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"This swing is wonderful I just love it. It's cute, not too big and swings my son right to sleep. My son loves the bright colors and music. We have all the rainforest products. I would highly recommend this.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"I read other people reviews before I made my choice for my newborn baby Girl. The best buy, she loves it, and all my family loves this product because we can do something while she is so comfortable there.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"I bought this for my niece for christmas. She loves lights and that was the reason i got this. She loves it. it vibrates, has moving animals, and music. great product",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"All 3 of my kids loved this thing.  They would stare at it all day if I would leave them in it that long.  The only downside is that it burns through batteries quickly, so I recommend buying rechargeable batteries.  We use the Eneloop batteries that are also available on Amazon.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"I bought this bouncer as a marked down item at Babies R Us. It did not come in a box so I assumed it was a display because it had no wear or tear to it.  It seemed to work fine at the store but when I got it home the animated frog started the horrible clicking/popping noise and getting stuck.  I was going to exchange it today, but after reading the reviews here and at Babies R Us I may buy a different bouncer now.  It would be a really great bouncer if not for this defect!",3
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"I have had this bouncer since day one. My son is now 7 months old and still uses it. Out of all the baby gear we have bought, this is by far the most used. I did have a problem with the frog clicking but I simply called Fisher-Price and they sent me a redesigned replacement bar at no cost to me. That fixed the problem.I like how the toy bar comes off, this way he can interact with me while I do other chores around the house (i.e. dishes) and it keeps him from crawling off when I cannot easily attend to him. The music is very pleasant and fun to listen to...I did not find it to be loud at all. My son really enjoys this and gets excited playing with the monkey and parrot, which do not seem low for him. He is 19lbs now and has no difficulty in the bouncer. I do own other pieces from Rainforest collection and find them to be good products as well.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"My baby used this up until about 4 months. I was hoping she could have used it longer but once she started rolling I was afraid she would roll off it. Also, as she got bigger the back laid down flat like she was laying down. She prefers to sit up a little more. The rainfall and lights were ok but it was a very short period that she was interested in it.I also have a bouncer that converts to a rocker. I got much more use out of that as a bouncer because the seat is much deeper and she can't roll out.",3
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"For a newborn, it's hard to find something that will keep her awake but not fussy. This bouncer is the only thing that does the trick! Mind you, she may not stay awake long or be far off from crying, but she is entertained for various periods of time which is great! I get two free hands to do a few quick things and she is safe and secure. I also use the bouncer when I take a shower. I can carry it into the bathroom with me and know she's safe and secure in the seat and being provided some measure of comfort. My only complaint is that there is no adaptor for this- unlike the full size swing- and 4 D batteries don't come cheap! A really great product though. My daughter is now only 1 week and 4 days old and I have been using this bouncer since the day we brought her home from the hospital!YUUUP. All was great until it broke after only 2 weeks of use. I wouldn't be so mad but I bought the Rainforest Mobile- that was broken. Bought the large Rainforest Cradle swing- motor was burnt out on that too. Now the bouncer is broken. The only thing I bought that still works is the Rainforest Crib Side Soother. The worst part is that FisherPrice.com doesn't allow you to email them regarding any complaints or questions when an item is broken! I'm really angry because I spent a lot of money and everything is burned out after only 2 WEEKS!?! It'd be a great product if it wasn't such a mechanical failure and POS.",1
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"My baby loves it.  He can stay in his chair for hours and he enjoys its music and lights.  He doesn't like the vibration, but I don't care about it.  I recomend it and I will keep it for my next baby.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"My baby loves sitting in this chair! He gets a little bored of the toy attachment but we take the seat all over the house. He watches me cook and do dishes, entertains himself while I shower and watches me do odd jobs around the house. It's very stable and almost impossible to tip over. Just make sure you buckle baby in because all they have to do to fall out is arch their backs. Also, this thing will trip you on your face like nobody's business so be very careful when walking past it while holding your little one. The legs stick out farther than you think!Finally, be careful when attaching the toy bar while your baby is sitting in the seat. I always watch out for his hands but still managed to pinch my boy's little fingers in it once. His screaming broke my heart! ( he was ok).",3
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"my daughter loves this chair and finds it very comfortable, Its great for me because it entertains her so I can make coffee!",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"This is the only toy, bouncer, or carrier my now 10 week old baby likes.  He has been using it since about 5 weeks old and he just loves it more and more every day.  He loves the moving little animals and the lights on the waterfall.  The lights made it very useful for a young baby who was too young to play with toys yet.  Now he sits there and ""talks"" to the animals.  This is the only way I can get anything done around the house.  BUY THIS!",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"My son loved the rainforest theme.This bouncer was okay, but my son outgrew it VERY quickly.I felt like this bouncer couldn't support his weight,not like I thought it should.When ever I put him in, he was practically laying down.In the end, my son was only able to uses this for about 3 months.",4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"Amazing toy. My 7 week old LOVES this toy. When he kicks or his hands hit the toys, it activates the waterfall and makes the animals move up and down. He will sit in it for an hour kicking constantly, which also makes the seat bounce. Wish I had bought this weeks ago!!! If it breaks, I'll buy another ASAP.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,I would have given this 5 stars but it is only battery operated. My 12 week old daughter loves this bouncer from the moment that I unpacked it and put it together. The vibration is great and she loves the parrot and the lights. With the vibration and lights and sounds going the 4x D batteries this thing takes can easily go in no time at all. Two weeks we have had this and already went through 8x D batteries. If this came with the option for batteries and a plug in cord than this would be 5 stars all the way!!!!And yes I would highly recommend this product. Though I have seen another bouncy on Amazon for half the price that looks very similar.,4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"We started using this bouncer when our son was just one week old.  I understand that other reviews find the overhanging tree part overstimulating,  But this piece is detachable!  We mostly use it without the piece...just let our son vibrate and bounce while looking around the room.  If I think he's interested in grabbing, then I add the piece.  Rarely do I bother with the music.  Just batting the toys is enough for him.  I like this because you can make it more stimulating or less, depending on what your baby needs....",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"My son loves this bouncer!  It's got vibration underneath the seat and moving animals with music and water in the forest.  He interacts with the moving parts and when he gets sleepy, he falls asleep as well (vibration helps!).  The bird and the monkey hanging under the main part have sensors.  Even when the music ends after playing for so long, it plays again when the baby hits the bird or monkey by moving around.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"I had such high hopes for this bouncer....I mean, I actually wanted to sit in it myself after seeing all that it could do.  But wouldn't you know it, I was sadly dissappointed upon receiving it.  My 3 month old son loves fun and games but would only sit in this chair for 10 minutes max.  The toy bar would constantly hit him on his legs and knees; he just could not sit in it comfortably.  Not sure how the baby on the box did...Additionally, for those who have ""nosey"" babies like mine, this chair may not work so well.  If sitting on the floor in his bouncer, my son could not see my face observing him while I was on the couch, therefore he would want the bar removed since some of his vision was being blocked.  Once the bar is removed, all the ""fun"" is gone and the chair gets real boring real fast.  Also I think he was a bit overstimulated between the lights and sounds on the bar at times and he would cry for me to take him out.  I thouhgt it was a fluke at first but after he did it a few times, we gave up.  Overall we tried this bouncer for about 2 weeks and today I am sending it back.  It's cute and seems to be a great idea, just poorly designed.  I hope you all have better luck with it.",2
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"I already had one from another brand, and my 4 month old wanted nothing to do w/ it...sister in law told me I just had to give this one a try and baby and I are so pleased.  One of the things not talked about is the smooth bounce it has.  If you put your foot on the metal bar and push down w/ a nice rhythem you'll find you can rock baby to sleep while working on computer or watching tv.  Also, Amazon had the best price...checked babies r us, target, and walmart.  free shipping as well !by the way, I order all my baby food thru amazon.  great service, and if you order over $ 25.00, choose the free shipping option.  :)",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"This is my sons 3rd bouncy seat and the best! He loves to bounce and hit at the monkey and bird toys. It makes nature sounds and also plays music. Great settings, great quality and lots of fun for baby! Highly recommend!",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"This is great, I bought mine used through craigslist. The woman I bought it from took excellent care of it. Everything works like it should. Braydon loves the gentle vibration and that moving parts at a little over a week old. I expect that he will really enjoy the setting that allows for baby to jiggle the animals to make the music, light, and animal movement start.  Wonderful chair, perfect for kitchen and bath tIme for momma to get things done.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"Just bought this bouncer and put it togather.  The seat seems soft and well padded which I like, and over all looks super cute.  Only problem is the sound bar plays music but none of the moving parts are working.  Called fisher price, they were really nice and are sending me a new sound bar.  Hopefully this will fix the problem, since baby is not here yet this is not a huge problem for me. Just hope it works!",3
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,Our baby loves the bouncer and spends a lot of time playing on it! I think it is a great value for money - highly recommend this product.,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,I absolutely love this bouncer. I find myself telling anyone and everyone with a new baby or a baby on the way that this is as necessary as diapers!I will never be without one of these and a swing. When my little one needs to be entertained so I can do the dishes or so I can pay bills or any number of other things that we as parents have to do I can simply put her in her bouncer and she is amused instantly for almost a full hour. It is definitely one of the best things I've ever purchase without a doubt.,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,Bouncer is great because the various features keep baby entertained. Batteries last a long time too. I don't hear the click others refer to in their reviews so perhaps it's a hit-or-miss.,4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"This was such a big hit, we bought a second one for Grandma's house.  Unfortunately, within about a month or so of almost daily use we began to experience the annoying clicking that so many other reviewers have commented on.  This eventually happened with BOTH of the toy bars.  After spraying a little WD-40 on the one at home, the problem was fixed!  We did the same over at Grandma's and that one now works perfectly as well.  This has turned out to be a great buy.  Baby loves to play with the toy bar attached, or just relax in the bouncer without it.  Definitely worth the money!",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"We got this for our 2 months old son; he is 4months old now and is now in love with his bouncer.Assembling it was quick and though initially I was circumspect about its stability, but using it over last 2 months I feel comfortable.Our son loves playing with us just laying back in this. Though he likes the toys, we use it usually without the top section(without music and toys) so that we have better eye contact with him.All in all, a wonderful product and highly recommended.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"My friend received this at her shower, and I my 10 week old tried it out first. He LOVED it so much I had to run home and order him one. I had already purchased an infant-to-toddler rocker, but he didn't like it.This bouncer was easy to put together, it is made well, and it really entertains my baby. I highly.recommend it.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,,4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"i was surprised to read so many negative reviews...my 5 mth old loves this!  Yes the rings come off easily,  but they're unnecessary anyway so we didn't even keep them.  My daughter will stay in it for not a very long time but at least 15-20 minutes. I don't think she'll fit in it at 25 lbs., but at 15 she is fine.  The waterfall and moving animals are a hit!",4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"This product saved me. I have a 2 year-old daughter and a three-month boy, I don't know I could have handled both of them without this bouncer. When I need to do some housework or feed my daughter and my little boy is awake, I simply put him on this bouncer, I turn on the vibration and the music (sometimes only vibration) and he stays, relaxes and even falls asleep (which it was wonderful the first 2 months when he didn't want to sleep on his bassinet). It's a good help for moms who are at home alone with babies.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"I purchased this bouncer a few months ago for my daughter who is now five months old. My baby girl was born with acid reflux, and like any baby who suffers from this, the doctor has recommended to start solid foods quite early, around the age of three months.  This chair is very helpful for a baby who cannot yet use the high chair due to the fact that she cannot yet hold her head properly.  However, because it is a bouncer the heavier the baby the more the chair sits reclined and this is where my suggestion is.  My baby wighs a healthy 17 lbs.Maybe, for a future generation of these kind of chairs, Fisher Price could use two vertical removable bars on both sides of the chair which can be mounted at the time of feeding keeping the chair higher up and also stopping it from bouncing during feeding.Currently, in my case, I have already found a solution.  I have a corner couch and at feeding time I place the chair on the corner of the couch and push it as close as possible to the back of the couch.  In this way the back of the bouncing chair is resting against the back of the couch at the desired high angle and and of course it stops it from bouncing.  Also, doctors recommends for babies with acid reflux to always lay at a raised angle, and even after feeding I keep my daughter like this for another 30 minutes before she can bounce happily away.  Since I do this, her acid reflux situation has improved considerably, she doesn't get hiccups like she used to and she has no more regurgitation.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"My little one loves this bouncer so much! He is actually in in right now ;o)It is so much fun for him! I notice that when he was a wee baby he loved to stare at the lit/moving waterfall. As he grew he aimed to reach the hanging monkey and parrot and now at 7 months he grabs them. Oh and the moving animals near the waterfall are too cute!The music is fun but be warned, it will be embedded in your head!! I find myself humming the happy little tunes while cleaning the house or waiting n line at the grocery store.A negative is that is eats batteries! But then again, most toys like this do.To round this up, I am VERY happy with this bouncer and will, without a doubt, use it again for child #2 :o)",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"A necessary item for any nursery.... You will have to set the baby down, sometime!Our little twins love theirs, the vibrations and music are very comforting.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,My baby loves it.It looks comfortable and the moving things and sound from the arch catches my baby's eyes for a really long time.Sometimes he even sleeps on this product.You will love it too.It's the best purchase I made for my baby.,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,Received this as a baby shower gift and use it often.My child is almost 21 months old and he still loves to be in it.I keep it in the bathroom with me while I take a shower so I can keep him busy.He finds it very entertaining! In the 20 months that we've had it we've only had to change the batteries once! Granted we don't use it for hours at a time but I still think it lasts quite a while.The colors are very bright and it is great for either a boy or a girl.Overall a great product!,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"we used it some but we used the swing far more to help our baby sleep or relax. you can live without this product though. after our baby was able to wiggle out of it, about six months of age, we stop using it.",4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"This review is for the Rainforest and Precious Planet Playful Snow Globe bouncers--because we own both--we LOVE these bouncers!First --the Rainforest version--this was our original bouncer purchase.  It has been an absolute life-saver!  Our daughter did not like to sit or lie in anything except our laps/arms--until we tried this chair.  She has loved it since first being placed in it around 6-7 weeks and still loves it now at almost 5 months.  The vibrating function is wonderful (just remove the toy bar and turn on the vibrating for a calming nap time seat) and the chair has just the right amount of ""bounce"" when she kicks.  The toy bar is really outstanding though.  From the glowing waterfall to the moving animals, this captures her attention and holds it--easily for up to 20 minutes.  This one has two great toys that hang down--the bird and the monkey.  There are also different operating functions--continuous play or child-activated.  By 8 weeks old, our daughter could operate the ""child-activated"" function and has preferred that.  It's the placement of the toys that enables the baby to easily reach and touch them.  The seat material is high quality with a colorful design that also interests her.  I couldn't say enough about how much we enjoy this product.  We liked it so much, we purchased another version, so we could have one upstairs and one downstairs, which leads me to...The Snow Globe version--same great basic design with the vibrating function and just the right amount of bounce.  We thought our child would like a little variety, so we chose this one.  We were not disappointed!  The toy bar is not as phenomenal as the Rainforest one, but it's still wonderful--and can hold her attention easily for 20 minutes.  In order for our baby to use the child-activated function she loves, she had to be a little more advanced to use this toy bar, because she needed to be able to reach towards the center with both hands in order to touch the whale, which hangs a little further away than the Rainforest toys.  She also seems to prefer the design on this chair a little more--she likes to try to ""talk"" to her ""friends"" on the chair.  One final note--the toy bar I initially received with this bouncer was slightly defective--the snow-blowing was weak and then stopped entirely.  Fisher Price customer service was outstanding in this matter.  After a short call, a replacement toy bar was sent out and we received it in a just a few days.So--all in all--oustanding product design and customer service!  If you had to purchase one, I would personally go with the Rainforest, but you wouldn't go wrong with either.",5
Lactina Double Pump - System Kit ONLY,"I realized at my job we have the Lactina pump - hospital grade, super fancy & expensive pump.  I bought this kit (I think for around $30) and it has been great!  No more lugging my heavy pump to & from work.  I used to have an Ameda Purely Yours, but after switching to the Lactina, I ended up buying a Medela Pump in Syle as well.  I found Medela parts to be way easier to clean than Ameda.  I love my Lactina!!!",5

Lactina Double Pump - System Kit ONLY,I had problems to nurse my baby during the first days because I didn't have enough milk and I had to complement her feeding with formula. So I rented a Medela breast pump from my local hospital to keep my milk production and ordering the double pumping kit I reduced the pumping time in 50%. Excellent option for moms that want to breastfeed the baby and need to use the bottle at the same time."",5
Lactina Double Pump - System Kit ONLY,"there isn't anything spectacular about this kit, it is the kit that fits on Medela's Lactina breast pump kit. this kit is nice because it is used on hospital grade equipment.",4
Lactina Double Pump - System Kit ONLY,"I got these to go with my breast pump since my old stuff was no good. I really like the manual pump but not as much as the original ones they had about 5 years ago. This one is difficult to use because you have to hold the pump with both hands where as the other one, you only needed one hand on the pump and one on the bottle. Either way, it works efficiently and I would recommend to every breast feeding mother!",5

Built NY Double Thirsty Tote Black/Leaf Green,"This tote is not 10"" tall as listed - its only about 9"" tall. Very few bottles can fit in it comfortably and mine certainly didn't. I ordered it based on the measurements and was disappointed to find them inaccurate.A message sent to The Baby's Gallerie did not elicit any communication from the seller at first - just a postage due return address label. Does Amazon let sellers get away with unfair return policies like: a standard $2.99 restocking fee even when the item is different from website description? Or ship the item back to us and we will see about a refund? E*** never would! Interestingly, the seller has listed the same item on E*** but described it there as 9"" tall approx. ???UPDATE: After much reluctance the seller refunded in full.",1

Built NY Tidy Bib Black/Leaf Green,"The make is fine, but I thought the bib was made of a smooth &#34;almost foamy&#34; wet suite material. The fabric is rougher than I thought. I'll need to save this bib for when my baby gets older because I wouldn't want baby to grab the bib and smudge the rough material over his face.",2
Built NY Tidy Bib Black/Leaf Green,So who would have thought that this bib would be such a great buy. I though the pouch would be more like a gimmick but boy was I wrong. This has to be one of the best baby bibs that I have bought. I really wish it came in more colors as I would have purchased a rainbow of colors. This bib is much more comfortable than the plastic ones you find around and if I had to knock it for something I would for the velcro. I am just not a fan of velcro on anything that has to go in the wash machine.,4
"Built NY Comfy Bib, Candy Pink",I've ordered this bib and the larger one several times and it's the best one out there.  So easy to wipe off food and the design is always chic. Forget all other bibs. This is the one to get.,5
"Built NY Comfy Bib, Candy Pink",Waste of money. The bib is so hard that it feels like a carpet. When mine arrived I threw it straight into the trash can. Making my baby wear this terrible item would've caused a neck rash  - like rubbing a mat again his throat. Don't waste your money on this item. This bib is so hard that I fail to understand how it could've been approved as a baby item!,1
"Built NY Comfy Bib, Candy Pink",LOVE this bibI'm the mommy of a big time drooler since she was 2 months. Cloth bibs get soaked in 10 seconds and give her a rash on her chest. These are worn all day without getting moist at all. perfect size. stylish. overall VERY happy. Just bought two more,5
"Built NY Comfy Bib, Candy Pink","I love Built NY Bibs, I own four of them!  I have had nothing but great experiences with these bibs.  I own both the ""tidy"" and ""comfy"" versions.  The ""tidy"" bib is best for feeding times and it 50% larger than than the ""comfy"" model.  The neck opening is much larger as well.  My son who is 6 months old and 18 lbs. is just now growing into the tidy bib.  The comfy bib fits him, not tightly but well enough that the drool doesn't miss the bib and hit his shirt.One of the best features of this bib is that you can wash it out in the sink after a messy feeding and it'll will be dry pretty quickly.  If you decide to wash this bib in the washing machine make sure that all of your bibs w/ velcro are fastened first.  ANY VELCRO that hits this bib will snag the material. I learned that the hard way & my first bib looked old before it's time.",5

Cosco Convenience High Chair,"Of course, you do get what you pay for. However, this chair has NO recline positions, it has only one setting and that is extremely reclined. My son is practically lying back once he is seated. It leads him to slide down and slouch, making it very difficult to feed him, or for him to pick at food on the tray. Also, it is a very flimsy design, making it easy to tip over, if baby were too active.I would not recommend this chair to anyone.",2

You have to have monster nipples to get these to stay on.,1

We plugged it into the wall and tried all the features: swing speeds, songs, light or no light, spinning teddy bears - all were great!

I like the music and sounds that it plays. The lights are nice and so is the mobile. I love that it plugs in (with a fairly long cord) so that we are not using so many batteries. The color is a purpleish blue that is gender neutral enough to work for either a girl or a boy. I also like that the tray comes off so for little babies who aren't playing yet, it isn't in the way of getting them in and out of the swing.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",My granddaughter loves the swing.  It is perfect now.  I did have to call to get a replacement ac adapter when first put together because it quit working.  Fish Price sent one right away without a charge and she is swing again.  Love it!,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","This swing is great!  It turns three ways, doesn't take up that much space, and goes all night long when plugged in.  We use it more than anything for our newborn to sleep in.  He sleeps so well in it!  He also sits and watches the mobile and stars for hours.  When he is fussy I turn on the mobile, lights and music, and he calms right down and watches the show, eventually falling asleep.  We received it as a baby shower gift, never got a gift receipt, and had the swing motor go out after only 3 months of using it.  I called Fisher Price and they where so nice!  They sent out a whole new motor casing right away, free of charge, and now it is still going strong 5 months later!  The swing has many different speed settings, so it's perfect for play and sleep.  Lots of different songs and nature sounds too.  My only complaints: It could be more padded so it's more comfortable for baby to sleep in. (We added an extra back and neck pad for ours) and also the motor casing is pretty hard and hands on to replace.  Took me a good hour if not more.  Other than that, this is such a great swing!",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","My infant is in love with her swing. This was a gift to both of us. As a mother of six, it is awesome to have such a soothing option that is so comfy and beautiful for her. She now looks for her butterflies every time she is put in...they are 3 of her best friends!! I can't say enough about it so stop reading and buy it!!",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","We really didn't use this as much as I thought we would, but when we did use it during months 1-4, our son seemed to like it.  We mainly used it for a place for Baby to take his evening nap, and evening is when babies are usually the fussiest.  Another reason we used it so much in the evenings--it was nice for both of us to come home from work and let him take his nap out in the main area of the house rather than putting him in his crib when we don't see him much during the day.  Baby can nap while parents cook dinner.  Not sure what the 6 speeds are for--we never could tell the difference.  Also, we really only used the side-to-side swinging; Baby seemed to like that best.  As for quality--it's Fisher Price, and we didn't have trouble with the motor or anything.  Another 'plus'--runs on electricity or batteries.  We never used the battery mode.",4
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","This swing is not only adorable but snuggles my little one and rocks her, keeping her asleep after she finishes nursing so I can get a few things done.  The set up was simple and I have never used batteries...the plug in feature is wonderful!!!  She likes to sit and swing with it in the upright position and toybar when she is awake.  I can also put her in the recline position and buckle her in.  She falls right back to sleep after I get it turned on.  She loves watching the butterflies (so do I) and at night they are so relaxing, but not so bright to interupt tv viewing.  Music choices aren't great, but not bad and more often than not I turn off the sound and we play our own music in the evenings.  I recommend this to anyone with a new little babe.  This is our fourth child, each had a different swing and this is by far the best.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",Was disappointed in the swing performance. My daughter borrowed an older FP model that my grandson loves. The starlight model barely swings and inexplicably changs speeds. The timing on the lights does not work well either. I would return this if I had saved the box.,1
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I received this very quickly and was very easy to put together.  I threw everything away as it was before baby was here.  I had turned it on and thought everything worked.  Baby arrives and use it longer than a few seconds and heard this awful clack clack clack.  The mobile was not turning and getting stuck.  Could not fix it.  Amazon shipped me a new one and I was able to use that box to return with their own shipping label.  Gave it four stars because it is a 20 mile drive to nearest UPS store that will take this big of a box, little inconvenient with a new baby....Edit:  Two weeks in on second swing and the timer that shuts off the lights and mobile has seemed to quit.  Not worth a return but this product is not worth it's price tag.  This is the starlight model.Edit again: 5 month old loves to grab the netting and put it in her mouth. This causes the mobile to get stuck and start clacking again. Also, mobile hangs low and she can grab them also causing it to start clacking. Had to wrap the string around the arms to shorten them.",3
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",So i haven't actually been able to put baby in it yet since she wont be here til tomorrow. however it is just like i imagined (i wanted it since i saw it a long time ago)might update once baby is here.update: my baby is now 6 weeks old and i am afraid i like it better than she does. it is very pretty. she doesn't hate it but she doesn't love it either but that has nothing to do with the actual swing just my baby's preference.,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","My son absolutely loves this swing. For my baby shower, I ended up registering for a much more expensive/over the top swing that my son ended up hating. They have this Fisher Price Papasan swing at the daycare he attends and the teachers kept telling me how much he loves it, so i bought one. I wish I had registered for this in the first place! The rotating mobile is adorable and keeps him entertained whenever I turn it on. The seat is very cuddly and washing the cover is a breeze. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone!",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",Was received in a timely manner. Upon receiving there were no nuts and bolts to assemble it. Once assembled it works swing wise. The sound volume doesn't work it is ""loud"" or ""off"". The lights are supposed to b on when the switch is flipped to a certain side. It works both sides. Sometimes it even stays on when the switch is in the ""off"" position. Im not happy for the money i paid. I kept it because i did not want to wait for another.,2
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I regret assuming that Amazon would not have this with free shipping.  I live in Hawaii and attempted to skirt around exorbitant shipping fees by buying a $75 cosco swing at kmart. This swing is a cozy little papasan with a smooshy pillow, mobile, projector, music and swing all in one. I could not ask for more. The only complaint I have is that my big boy is only 4 months old and although this is a full-size swing, it won't accommodate him for much longer, given his huge size (but the kmart swing would not have made it this far, that's for sure!).",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","The grand baby loves it.  That means it works, and everyone involved is happy.  That make us happy that we spent our money wisely.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",This swings is a complete life saver.  Everytime our little one gets fussy and we can't calm him....we put him in the swing and he calms right down.  We also used it to put him to sleep the first few weeks!  He doesn't really care about the ligths or anything but we still use them. We always use the swing on the fastest setting!  I love that you can plug this in so we don't have to worry about the batteries running out.  I would recommend this swing to EVERYONE!,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","Little Lamb has been the single BEST item we have got/received for our little girl so far. She is a great and lovely baby (knock, knock) but, in those moments when nothing works, putting her in the swing works like a MIRACLE.  It calms her down immediately and she falls asleep within minutes.  Also, she really seems to enjoy the music and movable toys. Being a newborn, she already follows them with her eyes and smiles frequently. Of course nothing compares to mother's arms but, even a super-mom, cannot provide it 24/7. Little Lamb has been of great help!BTW, as multiple reviewers mentioned, the music and the toy carousel work only for 7 minutes and after that you have to restart it. So far it has been only an advantage to us, as the newborn attention span is probably shorter than that and it definitely saves the battery life. We will see if it is going to be the problem later on.On the other note, after we went through our first set of D batteries we ordered from Amazon Tenergy rechargeable D batteries (10000 mAh). They DO last forever... so far.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","The Best Swing in the World, My baby loves this too much and she sings song with its lullaby music.\\Would recommond to others.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","My 4 month old daughter tends to take longer naps while she's being swung, however the motor is LOUD and make a constant CLUNK noise (and no, it doesnt sound like there is something wrong with it - just seems like the normal sound)right above her head and it startles her when I lay her down for a nap. The swing function really does not vary much - when she was a newborn even the slowest setting was WAY too fast (she was just under 7 lbs) and now at just under 15lbs none of the speeds make much of a difference.I'm also not really a fan of the music - it's kind of fake/tinny and actually kind of creeps me out a little bit.The colors are very muted, but she does like the lights above and they show onto the canopy very well at night with dimmed lights. This is also a very awkward swing to move and it does take up a good 3 feet of space.",3
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","This is the best baby swing. I did a lot of research, and even though this is an older model swing, it's much better than the newer versions by Fisher Price. My boy loves the swing. it's comfortable, lots of things going on with the projector, music, and swinging stars and bears. The added canopy adds a special touch that other swings just don't offer. Best baby buy so far.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",This was a lifesavor for me when I had my newborn.  Easy to put together.  Love the soft music and lights it has.  LOVE the fact you plug in rather than keep buying batteries.  this is just a must have staple for every new mom.  GREAT price too!,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",Gender neutral swing. My son loves being in this swing and I love the fact that is can be battery powered or plugged into an outlet. It isn't very portable so if you are looking for a swing to be able to move around alot this is not the swing for you. I also like the fact that the toy bar is removable. It has a removable infant head support also which is a nice feature.,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I am not at all impressed with this swing. We previously had the fisher price ocean wonders swing and I loved it. Infact, we owned two of them and the only reason I didn't buy another one is because they are nearly twice the price we paid previously when our now four year old daughter was a baby. I figured that this cradle swing would be a good choice because of the reviews and the fact that it is the same maker but all of the speed settings are the same whether it is on one or the fastest setting and even the fastest is super slow. Also, the swing is loud. Our daughter loved the ocean wonders one and to get this one in comparrison is such a dissapointment. I rate it two stars because it doesn't soothe her the way I thought it should because of the slow speed.",2
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","Baby is about 3 months old now and we have had the swing for about 2 weeks. I like many of the feature such as batteries not required, the mobile and stars for the baby to watch and 3 swing angles. Baby likes to sit and watch the mobile but is not happy with the swinging motion for some reason. The papasan cradle only has two recline positions, laid back and very layed back. This is ok since the baby is not able to hold its head up anyway. Swing motor is a bit noisey, louder than I expected. This likely explains why the softest music setting seems a bit loud too. Bottom line: Lots of nice features, stable, looks comfy but my 3 month old could do without it. I am guessing she will like it better in a month or so.",4
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",Love that it has a wall plug but the motor is weak so there is really only one speed for the swing.  Baby loves the lights though!,3
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",We received this swing from a friend for our new baby.  It came from amazon so quick and setting it up was pretty easy!When we brought our new baby home and used the swing there was a very audibly loud clicking noise whenever we would turn on the mobile because the mobile would get stuck for some reason.  It was horrible.  Somehow our baby girl didn't mind although sometimes it startled her.  We hated the noise though.  After a week of not being sure what to do we called Fisher Price customer service.  It only took less than 5 minutes and we had an entire new motor housing being shipped to us for free!  It took a bit over a week to get the new motor housing but it was easy to switch them out and now it is perfect!!I had originally wanted the little lamb swing but it didn't plug in and it was more important to us not to have a battery run swing.  I do love that we can used batteries if needed but right now its plugged in. Honestly I am glad I went with this one because its NOT white so the off white hides spit up.  Also our daughter adores the starlight show! She just stares and stares till she falls asleep.,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",This swing is so wonderful.  I have used this swing since my baby was a day old.  She is now 13 months old and still takes long naps in it! I like how it can swing side to side or front to back.  This swing has helped my daughter take many peaceful naps!  I am so happy I purchase it!,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",This swing in the butterfly garden version is awesome. My little princess smiles with delight when being placed into this swing. This swing was great for her as a newborn because we never worried about her head slumping over in it. It comes with an AC adaptor so you don't have to use batteries. We purchased this swing/cradle in addition to the one we already have and it has been worth every penny.,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","When I went out to buy a swing for our baby it was the last thing I needed to get before she was born.  I had no idea what I wanted after shopping around and testing every swing in 4 stores, I decided on this.  Reasons...I love the fact it is a cradle or it can sit up.  It swings side to side or front to back.  It can face different directions.  The color is neutral (I got the lamb one).  It plays many songs and sounds and has numerous speeds...most of which I do not think I will ever use. and it Is very quiet when it is on.  Things I am not 100% found of...It is BIG and bulky (not for small places) and does not fold for storage and it runs on batteries (that I have only changed once in 3 months).  Still I would buy it again if I had to.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I purchased this swing for my expecting daughter. I was pleased that she could plug it in an outlet or use batteries. It had other good features like illuminating stars(removeable}, music, rocking movement(side to side), and the sound of outdoors(crickets, frogs etc). It was easy to put together which is a plus. My daughter would not be without a swing as my first grandbaby loved hers. Also last but not least the name Fisher-Price has a good reputation.Grandma",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",This fisher price cradle swing is great! My baby has colic and this swing is just about the only thing that will calm her down. We use it every day! The only downside is that it uses lots of batteries because we use it so much.,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","Baby isn't here yet so I'll update my review after LO is in it.But I got the purple colored star swing. It's very very cute. I'm almost 8 months pregnant and put most of it together on my own. Fiance had to help with some of the stuff but had he not been around I probably could have managed it on my own. The only complaint I have is the noise. I'm a first time mom so I'm not sure if other swings do this but when you turn it on you can hear the motor running and trying to rock the swing. If I turn the music on on the swing I can't hear it though so I guess it's not too loud. I have a feeling it might get noisier over time though. But really the swing is so cute and has all the functions I wanted so I'm not too bothered by a little noise.UPDATE!!!!I bought this swing almost a year ago while pregnant. When my daughter was born she initially hated the swing. You couldn't even set her in it awake or she'd just scream. When she was about 2 months old, however, she started loving it. And now at 6 months old she refuses to sleep anywhere except her swing! My only complaint is that my daughter likes to pull on the netting around it and on the mobile and then it starts making a very very loud cranking noise. I think I'm going to have to take the netting off and make the mobile shorter so she can't reach it anymore. I also didn't realize that this swing has two positions, a cradle position and a sitting position.After using the swing for about 2 months it started shorting out but then stopped a few weeks later. I'm not sure what caused it and why it stopped randomly but we haven't had an issue since. Other than that I think the swing is great. Definitely worth the 120 dollars I spent on it and I HIGHLY recommend getting one. It's been a life saver when it comes to nap and sleep time.ANOTHER UPDATE!!I think I jinxed myself with my last update. The swing completely stopped working 6 months after I started using it. I didn't pay 120 dollars for 6 months worth of use out of a swing. Worst part is that I'm just out of my money because I can't return it to Amazon and Fisher Price wants me to pay the shipping to return the broken swing - which as I'm sure you know, is very expensive on such a heavy and bulky item. I'm not happy.",2
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I bought the Nature's Touch Papasan Cradle Swing by Fisher-Price in October 2005 when expecting my 3rd child that December.When he was born, he (and thus the family as a whole) *loved* the swing. I loved the neutral colors. The music wasn't overtly annoying (for a change), and that its volume could be adjusted. The cradle portion looked and felt soft, thick, and comfortable, and was easy to remove for washing (became even softer with fabric softener ;-) ). Loved that it had so many different speed settings and loved that it had 2 different motion settings.When he was super little, I kept it fully reclined, and it was like he was being cuddled in mom or dad's arms as he was rocked side-to-side. I also added additional support via the Kiddopatomus carseat padding that has thick sides as well has head/neck support. As he got older, switched it to its ""upright"" position (still slightly reclined), and away he would go. He liked the mirror ""ball"" well enough, but never cared one way or the other for the mobile and its ""friends"".The swing power was very good --though it would slow down considerably (and understandably) if a blanket dragged or hung down below the cradle seat -- in either direction; I rarely used the highest speed as I found that to be *too* fast unless batteries were dying.Battery usage was typical, but not too bad considering its frequent use. Rechargeable batteries are a *must* for any battery-only-operated *anything*, IMO.I forget how long my son was in this swing -- up until at least 6 months, I'm thinking, if not longer. Can't remember. However, this swing was loaned out several times over the last 3 years; my friends and I got my money's worth out of it.Unfortunately (and what drops the rating down by 1.5 stars for me), now that I've had my 4th child, my friend who used it for her son just over the last year returned it to me, and it no longer works properly. It stopped swinging. The music and mobile work; the swing does not. It costs approximately (at least) $50 to fix (might as well buy a new one for that, which is what I'm going to do; plan on getting the Starlight with plug-in adapter this time). It just stopped working out of no where; one day all was well, the next, nothing.Then it started working again a few days later when I was complaining to another friend about how it no longer worked... only to not work again the next day.I figured out that if I put my son in it and pushed it and *then* turned it on, sometimes it would work and keep swinging. However, if I didn't hear the sound (kind of a knocking sound) of the motor, I knew it would eventually come to a stop and thus wake up my baby and annoy me. Sometimes if I turned it off and then back on, the motor would kick in. Today, though (and last night), it has not, and therefore, I'm getting a new one (different model) because my new baby has decided he likes the swing after all... when it works.This baby loves the mirror already (he's 5 weeks), and notices the mobile and its ""friends"". Don't know how much he cares for the mobile though... it doesn't make him cry anyway. :-) He does seem to prefer the cradle rocking over the swing rocking, but then that's because of its positioning next to my desk; he can watch me that way.Overall, a very good swing and I recommend it with rechargeable batteries (else get the adapter version); however be aware that it might not last you as long as you might think. If it wasn't for me loaning it out, it wouldn't have lasted through more than 1 (of my) baby, since almost 3 years later, it's kaput. I prefer for my baby things to last at least through 2 kids.Now I'll be purchasing a new swing for only 1 (as this is my last) baby... but that's what eBay is for.",3
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",This swing was easy to put together and I enjoy watching my granddaughter look at the lights and the butterflies when they are in motion. Luckily the swing also used batteries because we had a problem with the AC adapter not working. We called Fisher Price customer service and they sent another adapter out to us. The swing is now working perfectly with the AC adapter.,4
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","After purchasing 2 different swings that my newborn daughter didn't care for, I opted to purchase this model and she loves it. She gets amusement from staring at the lights and rotating butterflies and the rocker lulls her to sleep. This was a great investment at a great price!",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","We just got this swing for our 3 1/2 month old daughter about 3 weeks ago. Can I tell you she LOVES it!!! She just lays back and watches the lights and the butterflies pass by. I LOVE the fact that it plugs in! I was getting it out of the box and thought OH NO, I don't have batteries. Then while ""I"" was putting it together I saw that it plugged in....WOOOHOOOO! As you can see, I put it together myself...it was that easy! I was SOOOOO Excited when I saw it here on Amazon for $114 SHIPPED! I had waited a while to get one because I REALLY wanted this one, I just couldn't pay $159 for it so I JUMPED on it when I found it at this price. BUT it would be worth the extra $$...we LOVE it that much!Rachel",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","This Swing is a must for any parent of a new baby! Me and my wife are new parents of a baby boy and sometimes he just wants all the attention. At a month old we put him in this swing and it is incredible how quiet he stays watching the little bear and 2 stars circle around while listening to the music.This swing is SUPER easy to install. One person can do it in no time. It is very cute, but most important of all, it has an AC adapter!! Which means that you don't have to spend a fortune on batteries! Just plug it to the wall, adjust the settings and that's it! It has multiple buttons to control the different settings, from how fast it swings, song, volume, toy rotation and light projection. Very user friendly.Short and sweet: from my personal experience I recommend this product without a doubt. I believe you will find it very useful.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","The lights with the little moving butterflies mesmerize my daughter.  She loves the swing and it's a great way to occupy her so I can do a quick load of laundry.  There are several songs, so you don't hear the same thing over and over.  There are other settings with nature sounds, crickets, etc.  It's a cute swing and I would highly recommend it.  The motor is pretty quiet.  The span of the legs is pretty wide, which you should measure for.  But, it does make it seem safer.  I did purchase it for the $120- $130 range directly from the Fisher Price website.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",We deffently got our money worth our son loved this and was in it until he could not fit in it anymore.,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","This was a necessity (as much as I'd like to say otherwise) and I highly recommend it.  I'm not a fan of fisher-price in general due to the fact that they are not the most conscientious company, but this swing is great!  The seat is comfortable and safe, the motor is strong and quiet, the mobile is a nice touch, and the seat cover is easy to clean.  This swing soothes a baby's nerves when they are in their ""4th trimester.""  My son napped in this swing regularly as a newborn and it did not hamper his ability to transition to the crib when the time came.  Be very careful when taking the baby out of the swing when they are in the ""front to back"" swinging position as the baby can arch his back and cause a fall if you're not holding on to baby securely OR just leave the swing in ""side to side"" postion to be extra safe.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",I am very happy that I purchased the Fisher-Price mocha butterfly cradle swing. I am a single mother and if it weren't for this swing I would never get anything done. My almost 3 month old wants to be held all the time. The only break that I get from holding her is when she is in this swing. She loves it. She has severe acid reflux so the doctor doesn't recommend laying her flat so this swing works well for us. I love that I don't have to purchase batteries. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars because the mobile doesn't always work but I don't mind much because she is usually asleep and if she is awake she isn't interested in it.,4
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",We bought this swing back in 2007 when our first child was born and we loved it! We used it with our second child also but near the end of her using it the motor was getting a little weak. Now we our on our third child and the swing still works though we can tell that once this baby is done with it the motor will be no good anymore.I think this is a great swing and for us it has been well worth the money we spent on it as it has lasted through three children who are/were swingaholics.,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","We bought this for our son because it is sweet looking yet doesn't scream GIRL.  We've had no problems with the mechanics of it.  The music is very nice; I like that you can vary the sound level and that there are so many musical options.  The only complaint would be that it doesn't appear to swing very fast, but considering he likes to sleep in it, a fast swing isn't really necessary and it certainly swings adequately, just not wildly.  The mobile is very cute and our son loves to watch the stars and bear.  The lights work GREAT, casting both on the netting and on the walls and floor.  It really is fun to look at.  The papasan seat is comfortable and cozy which allows him to sleep quite well in it. Last, I really like the style of it.  Everyone I know has the Nature's Touch swing, which is mechanically identical (and very nice), but I get a LOT of oohs and ahhs with how adorable this one is.  We love this swing.  I look forward to using it with our next baby.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","The plastic seating shell is too deep for this and I found my baby on the floor sadly this am. Luckily she didn't cry for long and the chair is close to the ground (vs the Snugabunny). I didn't buckle her in because she was swaddled. I do not recommend this. I do have the snugabunny but the motor broke. The plastic seating shell is similar but not exactly the same... I would rather go for the snugabunny if given the choice. In my case, I took the snugabunny seating and stem attachment and attached it on the Papasan Cradle Swing. I got the best of both worlds I guess. FP Swings suck in the way that the motor breaks and they are SO EXPENSIVE!",1
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",Very good product. It has worked flawlessly since day one. Granddaughter has thoroughly enjoyed this since an infant. Will be used with second child.,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","This is an amazing swing!  It was relatively easy to put together and it's so nice to have a cradle and a swing position to use.  It's really easy to switch between cradle and swing modes and it also has a recline or upright position that's easy to change to.  The light show is really pretty and while my daughter is just beginning to enjoy it, I know she will really like it real soon.  The best feature of all is that it uses a power cord instead of battery only.  It's so nice to know that the power is in full charge when you turn the swing on.  It also has a battery mode and takes D batteries if you need to use it away from a power outlet.  I just love the no battery mode and regular standard power!",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",Just wish it was as perfectly quiet as the fisher price lamb swing which we have. I bought this one for the tray as I feel safer. The lights and sounds are great. I think we will get used to the mild motor sound. I would think all the motors to these cradle swings made by fisher price would be all the same as far as sound in operation. The mild motor sound may actually be comforting to the baby is also my thought. Will find out as we plan to switch her to this swing today.The other lamb swing we will still use for awhile but feel much safer having the tray. So I have $300 in two swings. If I had it to do over I would order the swing with the tray in the first place.,4
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","My daughter loves the quality of this swing.  It's great that it rocks in two separate planes, and there are a number of ways to configure the music, the volume, the visuals, etc.  Love it!",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I just bought a second of these for other daughter Having bought the first more than a year ago. On the first daughter's advise my second daughter was told by her, ""This exact swing (Fisher-Price Starlight Papasan Cradle Swing - Cocoa/Pink) was a HAVE DO HAVE."" Only gave 2 stars to the rating would list as something important under negatives for all the people who get this swing (really deserves 5 stars).PLEASE NOTE:  We found out that when the swing is CLICKING A LOT AND LOUDLY it was almost always because the legs has shifted to a position (mostly too far apart} that puts the motor in a bit of a bind.  If you love the swing as my kids do, when you hear it making any overly-loud-clicking-noise: try adjusting the feet to a position where you can hear an improvement in the motor-clicking and so it doesn't run in a bind and wear out before its time.  Some of the newer, more expensive swings have a support bar across the back of the frame that might help to keep the legs from splaying or at least to keep the feet some standard distance apart and may make the swing last longer, but I haven't tried one to know if it works better or not.  A little attention to the noise can accomplish the same thing with a lesser expensive model that doesn't have the back frame support bar.Even if this recommendation is for one type of Cradle Swing, I can only imagine the same principle applies to others that are built the same way.

"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I was SUPER excited about this swing, I did HOURS and DAYS of research to pick out the perfect one for my son, and I admit that he absolutely loves it! And I do too, but not without a couple of pretty major flaws, and among these flaws, I am not the only one I've heard having them with this swing, Heard it from a number of people. Ok, so I've had this under a month and already have problems with it being defective. First of all, this swing is notorious for having a loud motor as it swings! Most babies don't seem to be bothered by it too much but its ANNOYING and for the price, it should not be an issue!! It makes a grinding noise, that's the best way I can describe it. Secondly, my son LOVES anything with lights so naturally we use that feature a lot, well 2 weeks after purchasing, it shorts out on me now- it will work perfectly fine and stay on for hours some days and then other days it will shut off on its own, sometimes as often as every 3 minutes! I did nothing to cause this so it could easily happen to anyone with this swing!! Then the last thing is, it just started another annoying thing yesterday- the mobile moves, and now when it moves, it sometimes clicks like its stuck- and when i say it clicks, it is LOUD and often several loud clicks in a row, and just when i finally get my son to sleep, it happens and wakes him up!! I CANT TELL YOU HOW FRUSTRATING THAT IS!! I've kept this swing in perfect condition for the one month i've had it, never even moved it from original spot and if all of these things are happening even in consideration of that, I can't help but question it's durability! It's truly a huge shame that it's this way because if not for these problems, it would truly be the PERFECT swing that has it all. So I don't really know if I should recommend it or not- I guess overall I *would*, but I'd definitely recommend with caution of foreseeable problems of any variety..Luckily I've heard FP has great customer service so I can only hope they will make it up to me so my son can continue to use the swing he loves!",4
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","This swing is hard to give a rating for me.Our baby loves it. He loves to look up at the mobile and mirror above him. I feel that he is secure and stable in the swing. The batteries seem to last quite a while-we use rechargeables for this. All of these things give it 5 stars in my book.But... on our swing-and I've noticed on a few other reviews-as it rotates around the top, the mobile gets hung up on the bar that holds the seat and makes a sharp, loud clunking noise. This noise continues until you physically move it just a bit. In the meantime, the peaceful angel resting below is startled awake. There are these little animals that spin and go up and down as they rotate around the mirror. The timing must be just off or something that they get caught in mid-spin. It's really too bad, because our baby loves the mobile.",3
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",It is adorable. I absolutly love it and it will be put to good use when Addison gets here.The baby will love it.,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","This came, and the picture doesn't even do it justice.  It is so super cute.  The fabric is so soft you can't resist touching it. The colors are bright.  There are tons of features.  This is my fifth baby, and this is the best swing I have ever seen.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","Great product.  I love that I Won't need batteries.  As a daycare provider, this is a great option and a very sturdy product.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","This is super cute, but it's just not safe. Only put baby in it once.The Harness is only 3 point:The harness to hold the baby in is pretty much useless. We have a graco swing that has shulder straps that is much safer. The straps on this swing are only around the waist of the baby and allows for too much wiggle room.Too Loud:When the swing operates it is very noisy.Unstable:The design of the swing lets the seat hang suspended in mid-air. Other swings have two bars holding the swing seat up and it just seems safer. The seat on this swing wobbles back and forth and makes me too nervous to put baby in. Make sure you have the legs of the swing spread apart as far as they will go.SLOW, Doesn't change speed:The speed is slow. I don't really notice any change in the speed regardless of what level I put it on.VERY CUTE:I got this because it was so cute, but all in all I'm not going to keep it beacause of the safety risks. I'm just going to stick with the graco we already had. This swing is adorable and I love the canopy and mobile, baby loves it too and tries to reach for it and I'm afraid she's going to fall out because of not having shoulder straps. The projection is neat. But I can't use it because I just don't think it's safe.",1
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","One speed, not 6.  Can't hear music over noisy motor.  Angle baby rests is poor.  Would not recommend!!!!!",2
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","i chose  this swing because of the combination of lights, toy tray, and side to side swing... i had wanted one that the seat comes off to take it to another room as a bouncer but it wasnt as important of a feature to me.  i also like that this swing plugs in.  however, the two really pretty awful things about it:  first, the noise, good lord the noise.  both the swing mechanism and the rotating toy mobile, which you cant turn off and just have the light show.  very disappointing.  second, the rock hard seat.  how on earth would a baby fall asleep in this seat.  i will have to put some kind of a pad in there, and a kiddopotomus snuzzler isnt going to cut it.  good thing we like the lights and side to side swing, and the baby can sleep thru noise.  otherwise i'd be getting something else.UPDATE:ok, my 4.5 mo old daughter loves this thing.  i put an infant insert that i dont use from a carseat under the swing's removable seat pad and that seems to have padded it up enough for her.  she falls asleep in it and doesnt ANYWHERE else (bouncer, glider, portable front/back swing, bassinet).also, i thought 4 days after I bought it that the motor had broken - it wasnt swinging. it would kind of try to swing, grind a little, then stop swinging... i almost packed it up and returned it BUT my husband had just vacuumed and had moved the legs a little - so I made sure the legs were both pulled out as far as they could go. VOILA!!!  still swinging strong. so if you think yours has stopped swinging, try pulling the legs all the way out. it needs a really wide stance and to be very level for the motor to be balanced.really this thing is just SO loud and without the insert from my carseat would be so uncomfortable i think it still deserves just a 3.  tho when i buy a 2nd swing for upstairs (which my baby is begging me for) I will probably get another of these.  she likes is so much.  she likes the canopy too.  its like a little tent for her. and the rotating light show. so I will upgrade my rating to a 4, i think thats what my daughter would rate it.",4
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","After debating between this swing and the Fisher Price Ocean Wonders Swing, I decided to purchase the Papasan Cradle Swing based on the large numbers of positive reviews on this site.The seat is extremely cosy and comfortable and overall I think this is a good product, but it was just not for my baby.  Our son has been sleeping in the Ocean Wonders bouncey chair since we brought him home, which holds him up in a more upright position.  He hated the deep, nestled position that the Papasan swing makes you sit in.  If your baby is also used to sitting in an upright position, he may not like this swing.A couple other notes:-The mobile is poorly designed.  Your baby can really only see the bottom of the rotating animals for the most part.-The 2008 model of this swing is suppose to have an AC adaptor which was another reason I wanted to buy this swing.  The model I received from Amazon was an older model and didn't have this feature.-The music/sound shuts off automatically so you have to keep getting up and turning the music back on.I am going to try my luck with the Ocean Wonders swing which holds your baby in a more upright position.",2
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","Before my son was born I purchased a lot of baby gear second hand, but bought the Starlight Papasan swing brand new because the craigslist pickings were slim and I really wanted a swing with an AC adapter.  For the first four months we used this swing almost daily, and since then we've used it several times a week.  For us it has definitely been worth full price.I don't use the canopy; it's too feminine for a boy, and we almost never turn on the lights, mobile, or music.  The features we do love are the swiveling chair, the easily washed cover, the simple but apparently highly entertaining play tray, and the AC adapter.  It's still going strong seven months in, and despite its bulk I plan to store it for any future babies.  We love it!",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","My son had the boys version over 2 years ago, but only wanted to be held so we gave it away. Now my newborn daughter (she 3 1/2 months old) loves hers. The mobile and the lights don't entertain her for very long, but she takes all her naps which last between 1-3 hours on this swing. One of the main reasons I bought this particular swing is because you don't need batteries. We often forget to turn it off after taking her out and it never runs out of juice. For those customers who complain about the noise, I think they may have to open the legs wider. If you leave them too tight, it makes an annoying noise. Also if the baby and/or blanket is too heavy, it may make the same noise. I had too adjust the speed (level 3 for my 13 pounder and her blanket). I did not feel the need to start using the straps to hold her in until this week since she's become more mobile and could possibly fall out.  I sometimes also lay some sheets over the curtains on the swing to make it darker for her naps. Highly recommend this swing.",4
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I love it, my baby loves it and the fact that works with a regular electrical out let, even better so you don't have to keep spending money on batteries. ( you also have the option to use batteries if you chose).Great product, great quality, babies love them... My brother got one for his baby as well .... You will not regret it, and with the amazon pricing, you cant go wrong..",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",we bought this swing thinking that it would be a great for our daughter as a matter of fact it was great for about a week until my daughter weighed around 8 pounds and it was too much for the swing and it just Creeked and squeaked! All I can say is very dissapointed in fisher price I guess they are just not as good as their name used to stand for,1
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",I bought This swing For my grand baby and she like it. I got this Swings on Amazon for a good price.,4
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","Beautiful to look at.  Brand new out of box.  Swung for five minutes, maybe.  Motor stopped and so did swing.  Restart and motor will make sounds for several seconds and then stop.  Baby weighs 8 lbs so overweight child is not the issue.  Also, noticed the light display works and then does not work.  Terrible.  One redeeming quality is that it is a beautiful swing to take pictures of your baby in before you return it.  Good luck if you buy this one because with the quality control of this product,  it is like a game of Russian Roulette.  I bought this at Wal-Mart.com, so this will not show as a purchase from Amazon. Same product, though, with the same manufacturer.....Update:  Bought alternative, Graco Glider LX Gliding Swing, here on Amazon and had it delivered September 18.  This Graco swing has been great so far, with no motor problems.  The baby falls to sleep quickly and sleeps for longer periods of time.  Worth the money.",1
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",The swing was exactly as advertised. This was purchased as a gift for my newest granddaughter who will be born on 12/10/13. Her mother is looking forward to wonderful times with her little one with this swing. My son-in-law said that the swing was very easy to assemble. I especially purchased this swing because I like the features of it....the music and the lights that will help my granddaughter's eyes focus. This seems like a wonderful swing to welcome your baby into the world with. The colors of the swing were also wonderful. They were a soft lilac and being color.....perfect for a little girl!,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","All I can say is ""thank you"" ""Thank you"" , this swing is all it is made out to be.  Good price, and great to have if you need to be ""busy"" from baby for a short time.  Thank you [...] for your fast delivery!  Very pleased with purchase and results!GP",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","Not only does my granddaughter look sweet as pie in this cradle swing, but it does things I never imagined. You start it out as a cradle and just a little turn and it's a swing. Plus all the entertainment! Only one small issue is that it says there are different speeds of swinging, but no matter what speed I set it on, it still swings the same as every other setting. Overall, an excellent and beautiful cradle swing.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",This swing was even nicer than I expected.  It is everything it was advertised to be. I am delighted with it.,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","For the price of this cradle/swing, I'd hoped for a lot more quality and reliability than I got.  First, the stand seemed a little wobbly--you really need to make sure that the feet are as wide as possible when setting it up as they don't lock into an optimal position.  Even worse, however, is that after less than two days of use, the lights, sound, and mobile stopped working.  Calls to ""customer service"" were a complete waste of time and I ended up returning the item.  While the netting and other features appeared attractive and desirable, I'd have to recommend purchasing a less expensive Papasan cradle/swing.",1
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","After using it a month, the mobile on top made an aweful clicking noise scaring my daughter, then after 6 months the motor stopped working and I cant use it at all. I e-mailed the company hopefully they will be able to either replace it or refund me my money. SO UPSET.",1
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",We chose this swing after quite a bit of research.  We are so happy with our selection.  The swing was easy to put together (I did by lantern light during a power outage 2 days before I was due.)  The plug in option is wonderful and our son especially loves the side motion of the swing while he sleeps.  The colors are also very gender neutral.  I would enthusiastically recommend this swing to anyone.,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","We bought this swing after my daughter was 2 months old and I had suffered with a regular battery swing. The batteries always ran out and the swing motion was just to fast for me. I wanted a plug in swing that also had two different motions and my husband picked this one out.I am SO glad he did. Sometimes my daughter wouldn't sleep in her crib and once she went down in this swing, she was out. Yes the music (on low) is loud, but you don't notice it after awhile.I will say that we keep it in one area and haven't had a problem with the stability of the legs. The mobile and lights will sometimes go out, but I think that is a button issue and not the motor.Would I get this again....in a heartbeat. My daughter is now 7 mo. and is getting to big for this and tries to get out of it all the time. I'm sad to see it go, but I'm glad we had it for as long as we did. Well worth the money!",4
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I love that this swing has an a/c adapter and give the swing 4 stars for that alone!  We were constantly replacing batteries on our one that died.  Our daughter loves the swing, but because she's a little older, she's constantly grabbing the mobile and probably killing the motor a bit.  She also pulls the netting down.I also don't like that the seat is positioned in the way it is.  We've found our daughter perpendicular in the swing because she can so easily sit up.  That didn't happen in her old swing.I think the light is a little bright, perhaps keeps her up sometimes.  But, I love the cute design and the music is great.",4
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I shelled out the not-so-affordable cost of $150.00 for this swing when it first came on the market because my husband and I were expecting a baby girl.  I thought it was a bit steep for a swing (my son's cost me $50 when he was born and he hated it), but I decided that since family picked up most of the other necessities, it was do-able, and besides, it matched her crib set almost perfectly.  I am SO glad I bought it.My daughter turned out to have colic, and the only thing that worked was this swing.  If she cried on one setting, we flipped it to the other.  The lights and music seemed to keep her distracted from any distress from the colic, and every time we turn it on the look on her face is strictly wonder.  She completely refuses to sleep in her crib or bassinette, so for the past 5 months, she has spent virtually every night in this swing.  The best part is that it plugs into the wall, which is great because the last thing I need with 2 young kids is ANOTHER thing that eats batteries.These are my only issues with the swing (and I'd still buy it over and over if given the chance)... 1) It's very hard to transport.  It only folds in half, and my husband and I travel a lot to see family, so we usually have to take it apart or abandon it for the weekend (which results in no sleep for me). 2) The lace canopy I just had to remove recently because my daughter is a little grabby at 5 months old and constantly pulls it over herself and tries to suck on it, but no biggie. 3) After useing it every night for 5 months (which is about 150 nights at 8 hours per night) it gets a little squeak to it...WD-40 cleared it right up though.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","We bought the Tree Party swing to replace our 2010  little lamb fisher price cradle swing beause we wanted the AC adapter feature. I really regret it. The Tree Party swing creaks very loudly and incessantly. Naturally, this creaking wakes the baby. :( The music turns on at full volume and we have to quickly turn it down and the mobile starts with lights on and spinning. If we want just the spinning and no distracting light, we are again rushing to turn down settings quickly. These little issues would be fine if the swing didn't creak like an old tree in a wind storm- because of the creaking, it's almost unusable for our light sleeper.",2
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",A little tough to put together but definitely worth the price.  Love that it comes with an A/C adapter...saves $$ on batteries.  Another great product from Fisher-Price,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I love this swing it allows baby to sleep for a good two ours and has lots of sound and music as well three positions. Very nice curtain and very nice decorations.The colors are beautiful!! Just wanted to make the point that it is very noisy without the music going on. It starts to tick and creek sometimes but its very faint. My favorite part about it is that it plugs into the wall! I can save on batteries. Very large and comfortable seat for baby. My daughter loved it. Just one more thing that this item could improve on is that when people get it shipped to the USA it is free but when i bought it i had to pay almost double the price to get it shipped to Canada. I really didn't like that, I hope amazon takes into consideration that people around the world would also appreciate if the shipping was a lot cheaper.I was so happy when i got this but when it came two weeks later i found the exact same product but for $75!!! So i got really sad when i saw it, now the company is out of stock. But overall great product and its really worth the money. Hope other enjoy it as much as I did.",4
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I bought this based on positive reviews and most the internet reviews proclaiming how their baby can only or easily naps in Fisher Price swings. Sadly, this is not happen for us.  We introduced this swing when our son was 3 months and getting to the size where bouncing him and swinging him ourselves are killing our backs.  So what went wrong? (1) the motor! - The motor is loud and weak.  We used the 3rd setting and saw really not difference at the higher settings, meaning 3 was pretty similar to 4, 5, 6...  This might have been because our baby was big, but at 13 pounds, this swing should have rocked him to dreamland easily..according to the specs. (2) Maybe you have to start babies early on the swing? so If you are a bouncer the swing may not be an immediate success.  We kept the swing for a few weeks trying various speeds but ended up returning it because the motor was not really consistently performing and getting louder day by day.  Defective or short lived Fisher Price swing motors do not appear all uncommon so chalk up 80% of my review to that manufacturing fault.My suggestion is to either start early with associating the swing with naptime/sleeptime or start weaning your baby off motion for naptime/sleeptime once he/she gets too that weight where you can feel your back starting to hurt.  There is not reliable quick solution.",2
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",i bought this swing for my friends new born baby. this swing was easy to put together. and she became very fusy for a week but when i gave him this swing the baby loved it and didnt cry much after that. now she loves being in her swing. and its good for new born and growing babys,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I had a regular swing with songs and toys to look at... but my son had a hard time sitting upright and the songs drove me nuts! The Starlight Papasan Swing is completely comfortable for my son (now 2 months) and he absolutely LOVES the stars! He stares at them and smiles and coos at them. Also, I think I enjoy the sound machine as much as he does! There are nature sounds for night and day, and songs that won't drive you mad. The only complaint I have is that I have hardwood floors, so legs seems to slide into a position where they squeak every time the swing goes from one side to the other.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","It's the perfect set of &#34;extra&#34;  arms to hold my baby in when I need to do something. I love it does have an option to plug in the wall. The star light feature is nice too, great when it's dark and want to see baby. I had my little lambie swing with my first daughter and loved that swing. This one is almost the same but has the star light feature and wall plug. Super happy with it. Have had no problems with it :)",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","My daughter loves this swing.  As a newborn, she would fall asleep in it whenever we put her in it, and sleep for 4 hours.  We got so much more sleep because of it.  If she ever resisted, we could change the direction of the swing, which calmed her down.  She is 13 months old now, 22 pounds, and is asleep in the swing right now.  It works great when she is teething.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","We used this swing the first few months, but not that often and after a while while the motor became so loud that we just stopped using it all together. Very cute, but the motor is of poor quality for the price... things would turn off on their own and have to be restarted - I would just go with another one.",1
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",My husband and I love the swing. We bought it after we had already tried 3 different swings for our new baby and this is finally the one our 2 month old will sit in and stay for more than 5 min. He loves the lights it has and the direction of the swing. It says it is purple but it isnt. I think it is supposed to be lavander but is actually more of a pale blue. I would recommend this swing to anyone though very easy to put together and such a great way to entertain baby.,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I bought this product at a garage sale for fifty dollars.The things I like about this product are the overall design, it is very modern looking.I like that you can change the speeds for the baby and I like the colors.The music however sounded low quality.Also my baby's head always fell over the side of the swing, defeating the purpose of the head cushion. When i took the cover off to wash it I also noticed that what the baby is actually resting on is just hard plastic and there is no cushion whatsoever.Another thing I did not like is that the mobile is neutral colors. Babies love brighter colors, so my daughter basically ignores the mobile.",3
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I am fine with noise, but this swing is just annoying. The ""click"" or ""gear changing"" sound while the swing is in motion is terrible. I curse the very day I bought this swing. I put the swing together and thru away the box and a few months later had the baby so I cant return it now. I would feel horrible to sell it or give it to someone so I guess I'm trashing it. The bar over the legs is restricting also and I was scared to click it shut for fear of pinching his legs. My baby was a 13 lb newborn in this swing, and I don't think his legs would have fit in it another 2 months anyway. Everything else about the swing was awesome!",1
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","this swing is so pretty and just wonderful.  our daughter has loved it since she was 3 weeks old.  the butterflies catch her attention until she falls asleep.  the single thing i wish was different is that i wish the sounds included wombs sounds, then it would be totally perfect.  but this is still gorgeous and i use it several times every day.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","This swing is wonderful! When my newborn son is having fussy times and nothing seems to work, this swing does! It is soothing and he can lay down and fall asleep in there. The mobile, music, and lights also keep him happily entertained when he is not sleepy. I also love that it plugs in and is dual voltage (which is great for those of us who are overseas at APO addresses). Can't recommend this enough!",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",Didn't come with the cushion so I had to order it and wait another week just to set up the swing,2
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I has been over 9 months since we have purchased this swing and I have honestly say that it has helped a LOT. For a few months it was the only place where our baby would nap and not wake up screaming... Even now, when she is almost up to the weight limit we still use it when she is tired and needs a minute to rest however we do not use motor anymore just because she is to heavy . No issues with the motor before, it does make a ""clicking"" noise but is has never bothered us, we put the music on on the lowest lever and it was all good. Strongly recommend for the parents whose babies have sleeping issues.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","We bought this swing for our new baby.  It was a great swing at first, with the neat starlight show, rotating mobile, variable swing positions, and decent music system (well, it's not going to win awards, but better than most toys).  All-in-all we've been delighted with it, except that the mobile & lights failed after only 3 weeks of using the swing.  Nothing abusive was done to the swing.  Annoyingly, we had bought it a little before the baby was born, and the warrantee was expired.  My wife has found numerous reviews online that reflect our experience.In short, it appears to be a great product that's designed to self-destruct.  I suppose this makes sense from a business perspective.  This has a pretty limited useful lifespan for a single baby, and it would be easy for a dozen or so durable swings to serve an entire community.",3
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",My 6 month old daughter was fastened to the Fisher Price G2609 Nature's Touch cradle swing. She has been using it since she was born. The straps were secure and the belts fastened. She begain to reach for the little toys that rotate above the seat and wouldsit back down. She repeated the motions for about 10 minutes. She then reached again and then fell down over the side and landed on her shoulder and head  while her leg was caught on the fastened seatbelts. The problem appeared to be the way the seat belts are secured to the plastic seat. There is a sall slit where you stick in the end of the seat bellt and a fold at the end of the seat belt opens up and is suppose to not come out of the slit unless you fold it in a certain way and pull on it. This seemed to happen by chance and I deem it a very poor and unsafe design to secure a seat belt to an infant seat. My baby suffered tons of scratches and shoulder and head injuries but nothing serious but I believe tihs is a very dangerous product that utilizes a very dangerous mechanism to secure seat belts.,3
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I bought this item second hand. The baby loved it and the music/swing options are awesome. Its very comfortable and the seat adjusts a bit and so far it has been very durable. I would be careful because, as others have said, I did smell burt plastic one night while she was swinging. I dont know if I used it too much or what, but I will never leave her in the swing alone while it is on. This burnt plastic smell has only happened that once, but I would think it is worth looking in to. I still give it 4 stars because since that time, I have not smelled or seen anything and the durability, look, and even battery life are all pretty great.",4
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","Let me begin by saying that we bought this (the butterfly one) for our one month old because she liked to be rocked to sleep. We tried two different ones based on the way they rock - this one and the Fisher Price Cradle N' Swing. We returned the Cradle N' Swing for a few reasons: 1) the engine runs REALLY loud and since we bought it for night time sleep - that didn't work, 2) there was not much difference in the swing speeds, 3) the music was really more of play time music than night time music like we wanted.That being said, here are the pros and cons we found in this one:PROS:- We love the design and colors. It is so cute and very feminine for our only girl baby- We love the net around it - it offers a sense of security and is almost relaxing- The engine is a little noisy when it starts but runs softly providing a bit of white noise to block out the noisy older brothers- The lights are awesome for the night time when she wants to sit awake and we want to sleep :)- The music is much more soothing than others we have found. It also has nature noises which is nice and a volume button where the others were all just one volume.- The tray is removable so it can be used without it- Easy assembly - took us maybe 10 minutes top to put it together- The great Amazon price! We paid $109 here and the other one we tried (Same brand and fewer accessories and features) was $159 in Target :(- Comes with a plug to hook into the wall so it doesn't have to run on batteries!! Major thing for us since it runs often at night.CONS:- The lights turn off after what seems like maybe 10 minutes. Not a huge deal and not worth losing a star over, but still kind of a pain.- The papasan chair does not seem as deep as the chair in the other one. I know it should be in theory, but to me it doesn't seem like her butt fits down in the groove as much.Overall, we liked both chairs, but this one is amazing and relaxing for the night time like we liked. The net can be removed so it can be used as more of a playtime swing later, but for right now it suits the bill perfectly!",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","We bought this swing 2 weeks ago, and my 7 week old loves it!  However the other reviewers are right on, there is only ONE SPEED!  Which makes no sense, there are six slots to turn to and the speed stays the same, which worries me when she grows.  I am hoping the motor holds.I can't find 16 songs for the life of me, I have found 8 and lots of nature noises.  Plugging it in is the way to go, I don't have to worry about getting up to restart the music so that makes it worth the price.  We got a great deal on sale at Amazon, which I love by the way, for $116.00  Other swings are about the same with tax so I would recommend it.",4
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",works well and is very durable. I recommend it. Has many features and seems to be very comfortable for my baby.,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","This swing was purchased for our grandson and it is used daily. He loves it and absolutely loves the lights and sounds.I like this one a lot because not only does it have alot of features, but it also comes with an adaptor so we dont have to use batteries if we dont want to. Just plug it in.It was very easy to assemble, I did it myself in about ten minutes. Simple.I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to purchase a swing, best one I was able to find.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I love that swing can move to swing back and forth or side to side.  Having the option of using either the wall outlet or batteries were great. We bought this for our daughter in 2011 and she used it for a few months. We put it away and just took it out for our 2nd child. We plugged it in and it worked for a week or so. Then it stopped.  After some research, I found out this is a common problem with the swing. The motor and power plug needs to be replaced. Seems to happen after taking it out of storage, but not necessarily. Batteries worked, but I am constantly changing the batteries.",1
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","For the first month or so I'll admit that our son (now 2 1/2 months old) wasn't a huge fan of this swing- he didn't dislike it but it wasn't anything special either. However, over the past 2 weeks he has been LOVING it. It's great for calming him down or getting him to nap when he's tired and fighting sleep when nothing else we try will work.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","This is by far the best swing that money can buy. Also, it's much cheaper through Amazon than through any department stores. My one and only complaint about this swing is the mobile. It's a bit too plain and the bunny's ears get caught while spinning, causing a clicking noise. However, the good thing is that you can just turn it off. I never use the mobile and my one month old still loves it. The music, the nature sounds, she loves it all. Sometimes she just wants to swing in it while she's awake, but most of the time she falls right to sleep. And the fact that you can turn it to swing back and forth or side to side is an added plus! I highly recommend this swing to any parent, especially first time parents!",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",I read all the reviews before buying this items and the product lives up to the expectations. The toys (Butterflies) could have been little more attractive and the swing could have been little less noisy. Even that noise soothes my baby to sleep :) I still have to figure how to open and close the toy bar without completly removing it.,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","This swing was worth every penny for us during my child's first few months. Our daughter had acid reflux and laying her down after feedings was not an option. She was able to sleep soundly in this swing every day and night until her reflux went away. The cover is super soft and easily washable and now that my daughter is 5 months old, she still loves to lay in the swing to look at herself in the mirror and watch the mobile. I highly recommend this swing to all parents!",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",I had this similar swing for my 2 year old when she was a newborn.  She loved and my son did too!  It has so many features and lasted for a long time.  We recieved it as a gift but doing price checks this one on amazon was the cheapest.  I strongly recommend this to anyone!,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","We bought the Starlight Papasan Cradle Swing after the motor in our  Nature's Touch Papasan Swing  stopped working. We loved out Nature's Touch, so I didn't even look at the reviews for this one. I was so disappointed after putting it together. When it is on it's highest setting, it only swings as fast as the slowest setting on our Nature's Touch, which is not enough to keep our 3 month old happy or asleep!I called the company and they said that there must be a problem with the motor, so they sent out a new motor housing (for free) which I got within 2 weeks. It swings the same amount, so barring a really strange coincidence (two duds with the same problem) it's just the way it is.I'm going to try to sell this one and get a new motor housing for our nature's touch, which will be $35.",1
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",This item was pretty easy to set up and at the time I was 38 weeks pregnant and it only took maybe 30 minutes! I love that it gives you the option to either plug it in or run off of batteries! My baby girl loves it and takes naps in it all the time! She is actually napping in it right now! And when she is awake it's fun to just watch her stare at all the butterflies spinning around! Great item and would reccomend to anyone looking to purchase a baby swing!,4
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I love them but crackle sound is very not good . But very cheap.IAm satisfy.If you are sensitivity character,don't persuade.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I purchased this product after reading a lot of reviews from Amazon website. I am very happy with this purchase. The product was delivered in 3 days in great condition by Amazon. It was very easy to assemble, under 1 hr. Overall a great swing. My 1.5 mths son love it. He falls asleep in it right away. The lights and sounds are very soothing. The best thing is that you donot need BATTERIES. Just plug it and you can use it. There is an option of using batteries if needed.I would recommend this product highly.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","Well, I am so glad that the thousands of your reviewers got the little swing, like it or not, they got it!!! I, however, ordered this  product on 10/31/08; verified ""Thanks for your order"" email that day. Received another verified ""Your gift has left the arena"" email, dated 11/08. Arrived @ granddaughter's home late November and was surprised to find that she did not get delivery of the swing. To no avail, my attempts to find out where the swing is through Amazon.comllc and Fed Ex, which I paid $18.00 for delivery, met with some very and ongoing stress, as the # given to me for the order could not be accepted via their customer service site. ANDS I never received a tracking number, so Fed Ex was useless via their automated service. So, tomorrow I attend my only granddaughter's baby shower without a gift for my first Great Grandson. AND I have Amazon.com to thank for this!!!",1
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",We love this swing!  When we brought our daughter home from the hospital she would not sleep in her crib or her pack-n-play so we put her in the swing in our bedroom.....she slept great!!!  During the day we would let her swing but at night we would just put her in to sleep without rocking b/c we didn't want her to get used to only sleeping with movement. We slowly started moving the swing farther and farther from our room until she ended up sleeping in her own room.  She is 3 1/2 months old now and sleeping in her crib because she is getting very wiggly at night and ends up almost sideways when I get her up in the morning....so we decided it was time for her to start sleeping in a bed!I would recommend this swing to everyone...and so would Bailey! :o),5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","We were given this as a shower gift for out little boy. Fantastic. It can sooth, lullaby, and keep our baby calm almost whenever you need him to. Wonderful!!!",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",I am using this swing for my third child. It's beautiful and we both absolutely love it!! So many different options for the swing to tailor to your baby's needs. My favorite feature is that you can use the plug to the wall instead of using up a ton of batteries. I really wish I would have gotten this swing for my first two children. I recommend it to everyone I know who is about to have a baby.,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","Delivery service was terrible the swing almost fell out of the package when I carried it inside. The swing worked well though, it swung at a nice pace at first but now it seems to have slowed down but the reason could be that my son has gained 2 pounds since he first got it. We have had the swing for about a month now and have not had to change the batteries and thats with us forgetting to turn it off the weekend before thanksgiving . We came back and it was still swinging. My son mainly uses it for entertainment or a place to lay in after he has fallen asleep. He seems to just like the comfort of being held but the swing does help to keep him asleep better than the bouncer he has. Overall this product is great and I would recommend it to a friend.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","Got this for my newborn child who has sleeping issues. Motor is loud, but then it kind of sounds like the inside of the womb if you want to think of it that way.I don't really see a difference in the rocking speeds, slow vs. fast. They all rock about the same.Decor is cute and soft.  However the angle of the seat is too acute for a small baby. She was angled at 45 degrees and this can be dangerous for them, so I had to place several folded blankets in the seat so that she is more elevated and straight.It's also frozen on us one or two times.",3
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","Ordered this for my sister-in-law and new baby neice.  They love it.  Keeps baby happy and sleeping.  It has nice, adjustable music and soft cushion insert.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","Beautiful swing. My baby absolutely loves it!! There are so many options to choose from like the way she swings, the lights on, butterflies moving, songs that are played. I can say that she is comfortable enough to take naps in it. Very strong and sturdy. Swing is deep enough where baby won't fall out. Once again beautiful product that I love and my baby loves. Thanks Amazon!!",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I set up the swing, turned it on, and then came the loud motor. I cant believe fisher-price makes somehitng this noisy. Too loud for new born and to be honest, me.",2
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",I hate this product.  I purchased this swing gleefully!  I was sold on all of the bells and whistles! I rushed home and my BIL spent an hour putting it together.  This toy totally struck out!Strike one:  My BIL placed his tiny underweight 5 month old baby in swing for test ride. While swinging baby lifted her arm to tug at the mobile and the swing nearly fell forward.  Never mind the fact that she could reach the  mobile!Strike two:  The MOTOR IS LOUD!  VERY LOUD!  My washing machine on the spin cycle is like a fluttering butterfly compared to this BEAST!Strike three: THE Music is very annoying!I returned this blasted thing after one day of use!  I exchanged it for the Graco Papasan Swing.  I couldn't be happier!,1
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",Our baby can sleep in this thing for 3 hours.  She loves it!I have no reliability problems with it yet.  Best part is that you can plug it in or use batteries. We're buying a second for the in-laws.,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","What can I say, I love everything about it. It was easy to assemble, does everything it said it would and is cute to boot. The music is not annoying as I find most infant product music to be. The lights are bright and defined enough for my baby to notice and focus on. My daughter is colicky and won't let me put her down much but when she does she likes this swing. The only thing it lacks to be a truly all-encompassing swing is the ability to vibrate! I love the fact that I can plug it in and not have to worry about batteries. I think I'll keep this swing to use with my children's children (when they start having them in 15 years or so!) I like it that much! It does take up a bit of space but it's worth it and it's legs to fold in towards the center.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","My daughter has acid reflux and never took to the bassinet, and as we hadn't set up the crib yet, we ended up letting her sleep in the swing overnight. It worked wonders on her. In the bassinet, she woke up every three minutes screaming. In the swing, she sleeps thru for hours and has gotten to the point at night where she wakes only once for feeding. She's three months old now and we've been using this swing since she was 2 weeks old. It's a lifesaver for us. It has a good variety of settings for music, although we mostly use the first option, which is the 'sleepy' theme that includes soft classical selections. The hanging mobile is cute and rotates with the option to turn on the lights...my baby loves watching the little stars and moons moving above her head and around the soft net enclosure. The little netting is truly a nice touch...baby has a little privacy with that and it keeps the mobile stars and teddy bear from falling to the floor (they do have a habit of falling out although it's simple to clip them back in place). There's a bunch of different speed settings: at 1 it swings gently, 2 is moderate, and 3 is as fast as we usually set it although you can set it 3 or 4 speeds even faster than that. The motor is a little loud but not noticeably louder than the usual hum of any other swing. It folds up neatly and quickly enough that we don't have a problem moving it out of our bedroom during the day and back at night. The color scheme is also gender neutral and really flattering; I like that the cream and blue/lavender colors don't shout to be noticed wherever it goes. I have a small living room and the swing sits in the corner fairly inconspicuously. Hands down, this is THE best full-size bells and whistles swing you can purchase for under $120.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","We ordered this swing because of all the good reviews here on Amazon. When the swing came in I immediately put it together and plugged it in and turned it on. Everything seemed to work, but there was a little puff of smoke coming out of the motor. I turned it off right away. I waited a few minutes and turned it back on; it still swung, but the lights/mobile/music did not. So my husband and I messed around with it for quite some time. I was bound and determined to get it working again. After much frustration, we got the thing to work but only on batteries. What's the point of having a swing that plugs in when it only works on batteries. Actually the swing worked when plugged in, but if you wanted the mobile/lights/music to work we'd have to switch it to battery mode. Ok I could deal with that and that worked for about 1.5 months. Now...no mobile, no lights, no music. Which was too bad because my little guy really liked all of that.  Had I known how easy it was to exchange the disfunctional swing through Amazon, I would have done that in the first place. A+ to Amazon for their easy breazy exchanges. The day after I filled out the exchange info at Amazon.com, the new swing was on my porch. I assembled it, packed up the jankie swing in the new box and now my son can enjoy swinging, listening to music, watching the mobile and the lit up stars...and I can enjoy not having to replace batteries!!Fisher Price Starlight Papasan Cradle SwingGreat swing over all and if you get a lemon, it's super easy to exchange.",4
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",After only owning this swing for 3 months the motor broke. Thankfully I have a very handy husband who was able to find a different motor and replace it. The new motor is a little louder than the old one but I did not have to pay an outrageous price to get a new one.,2
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","Like all the other positive reviews this swing will entertain your baby as well as lull it to sleep.However I don't know about you but I don't like purchasing D Batteries every week. I have twins and two of these lil lamb swings. We go through batteries like you wouldn't believe. Why didn't they include the option of plugging in a wall charger or some kind of AC Adapter. I would have given 5 stars but since you can't plug this into a wall outlet I'm only giving it two stars.Summary:Will put your kids to sleep, but it will also kill your wallet by making you buy batteries every other week.",2
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","My grand-daughter would fuss at everything from birth. She would not sleep, and if she did it was a record breaking two hours duration.  My daughter bought this swing for her and the little baby fell asleep instantly in the soft side-to-side motions of the swing. It was a wonderful blessing for my daughter.  My niece bought the aquarium sister-model to the papasan and her daughter loved it as well.  However, the aquarium motor quit after only five months, and my daughter's papasan model quit after two years. Its sad, as she is expecting a second baby at the end of the year and was looking forward to using it.  Plus, it wasn't very cheap to be that disposable!",4
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",I have had this swing a little less than 2 months. I bought it for my 5 month old because she wouldn't sit in a traditional swing and I thought this looked like a comfy place to nap. It was a lifesaver til a week ago and and the motor burned up. I called Fisher Price and the part is on backorder til mid- May. I guess I just got a lemon because everyone else's seem to be fine. I am TRULY disappointed in Fisher Price. They usually exceed my expectaions. I paid $150 for this and it lasted til the water got hot and thats about it.,1
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I recently received this swing as a gift for my 2 month old preemie. She LOVES the lights, the rotating stuffed animals, and the sounds",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I bought this item for my brothers first born. Ofcourse he wants only the best for his little girl. He loves this thing. The canopy is sheer and when you turn the starts on, they light all around the canopy and the walls. It plays 8 night time melodies and 8 day time melodies that are perfect for any occasion. There is an easy access button in the front of the swing that allows you to change which way the baby rocks. The chair itself is so soft. It looks much more comfortable than those swings that have just plastic chairs and then fabric. My daughter had one of those and I had to put a bunch of blankets in there to make it look comfy. This swing comes ready. It really sets an ambient mood. My niece has not been born yet, but I am sure she will love it.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","This swing is amazing and my 2 month old son loves it. I did only just get it today so we will see how it holds up. But so far, everything works the way it is suppose too. I absolutely love it and would recommend it.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",Received this as a gift and my baby loves it! She usually takes a mid-day nap in it and smiles all the time.,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I am extremely pleased with this swing. My son has reflux, and this really does calm him.Just buckle the baby in and your hands are free, so you can make beds, clean dishes, and sleep!!!It has many differant musical songs, that my husband and I both know by heart... but they are pleasant, and rather relaxing (even for adults!).The swing has differant speeds, so when the baby is fussy, we increase the speed, and the motion calms him...It also offers 2 swing type motions...cradle(side to side), and swing (back and forth).Both make my babe happy.The Light Show is fantastic...and is not featured on any other swing--atleast i dont think so!! Very entertaining!Best part is-----NO BATTERIES!!! This swing runs on electricity...so when your baby falls in love with this swing, you dont throw away $$ on loads of batteries!Does come with battery option, incase you want to bring swing outside etc.OK as you can see I strongly advise you to get this swing. You will not regret it:):):)",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","It is an adorable swing but that is the only good thing about it. My 11 week old CONSTANTLY slumps forward in it. CONSTANTLY. She has great head control, it's just the design of the swing, I swear. When she falls asleep, she slumps forward. Sometimes it will just be her head that is slumped forward and sometimes she is folded in half at the waist. It totally defeats the purpose of why I bought a swing! I can't leave her alone in it for more than 5 minutes because it freaks me out to find her slumped over in it. I can't go into the next room to get on my computer to do some much needed work or go into the kitchen to do dishes because I constantly have to go lift her head back up. She's fine while she is awake, but every time she falls asleep, it's the same thing. I can't relax while she is sleeping in it. She sleeps great in it except for me having to practically wake her up to move her into a better position. What a waste of money. My son did well in his swing and I could even trust it enough to catch a much needed nap while he slept in it. With this one, I can't even walk away for 5 minutes without that sense of urgency making my heart beat fast and feeling rushed to get back and check on her. I try to position her butt in it different ways to try and create a position that will make it hard for her to slump over,. but nope! This is the swing that I have: [...]I don't have the box anymore but I want to trade it in for something else! My 11 week old is 14lbs and 23.5 inches. Like I said, she has great control over her head, but it's just when she falls asleep....SLUMP....SLUMP...SLUMP! It makes me nervous...to the point where I don't even want to use it except for the fact that I could really get some stuff done if it worked properly! AHH!",1
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",This is the best swing ever! Order and you won't be disappointed!,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",This swing is absolutely incredible. I bought it for my youngest daughter and wish that I would've had it for my other two children as well. I absolutely love it!,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",i had originally did not wish to buy a swing for my daughter because my son never used his and it was a waste of money and space. but the last few weeks of pregnancy i got antsy sitting at home and decided to look into different swings and possibly getting one. I saw this swing on babiesrus.com and babydepot.com not this exact one but plenty like it. I fell in love. Then i read reviews which are not great at all. Of course everything has its pros and cons. I finally decided this swing was the one i wanted and was going to take the chance on it. I went to baby depot to get it and they were out of stock and would take 8 weeks to get it. I couldn't wait that long so i went on to their website and went to order it and saw that it was another 30 dollars to have it shipped! fed up i took it to my facebook where my best friend who is an avid amazon shopper found the swing for me and not only was it 50 dollars cheaper then in stores but it had free shipping! No major problems with the swing other than sometimes speeds 1 and 2 dont work at first but if i put it on 3 which isnt that fast of a speed the first two will work. easily  put together *no help from my husband* and perfect for my daughter!,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I absolutely LOVE this swing. My son loves to be held in a cradle position, like his carseat, and this swing. He prefers being held, but that isn't always an option, and this swing is perfect. He takes his naps in this swing, he isn't old enough to enjoy the toy bar or the mobile yet, but I love the nature and music sounds. And the fact that is has two different swing positions. The only downfall I think this swing has, is that it doesn't have the plug in option, like the Fisher Price Rainforest Cradle swing. Which is weird, since they are the same type of swing, Fisher Price just didn't give the Papasan swing the wall plug in option. Be prepared to go through about 4 D batteries a month, but it is WELL worth it. And honestly, as much as we use this swing, 4 weeks isn't bad at all to go through only 4 batteries. I'll spend $5 a month on batteries if it comes to my son being happy and sleeping well. I would buy this swing over and over again, and recommend it to everyone.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","Being a mom of three this was the swing used for my third child. I loved, loved this swing.The positives: Soothed my baby instantly. I think the way the seat is it cradled her like I did. She didn't fit awkwardly like some other swing have. She would sleep for hours in this and it allowed me to get a lot done while she was napping. The swing went in two direction although, we only used it in one. It had soft soothing music and the stars would light up so if it was dark in the room you could still see her. It doesn't matter how many kids you have you are always checking to see if they are still breathing and with the lights I didn't have to race over there constantly.Negative: Once she got a little older she would tear the pretty canopy off...so eventually that came off for good! Also, with some swing you can let them in it for longer...this one she started to sit up and she would actually lean over and I was scared she was going to tip the whole thing over. I would suggest if you want a swing for an older baby that you have one that sits up but this is perfect for newborn up to four months...a true lifesaver!",4
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I really thought she would love it and I anxiously awaited it arrival.  Unfortunately, she just isn't into it - we call it the ""Swing of Perpetual Tears"" as she starts crying whenever we put her in it.  Now since she turned about 6 weeks, she will sit in for about 10 mins before she starts to cry so we are hoping that maybe she will grow into it a little more as its so cute.  And I LOVE that it runs on electric and not just batteries - that is the main reason that I bought this particular swing",3
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I absolutely love this swing. The feature, which allows you to plug it into the wall, is so nice. The last swing I owned, went through batteries like they were going out of style. I love the aesthetics of the swing as well, and my older children love to watch the butterfly light show. If this swing is an option for you, I highly recommend purchasing it.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",Very cute and love the light show option. Returned this item almost immediately however due to the excessively loud clicking and motor sounds when swing is operating. I couldn't sleep through that and wouldn't expect my child to. It even drowned out the music!,1
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",Pros:Looks great.Very comfortable for babies.Wider seatGood recline positionCons:The seat recline is not hard and could fall back.Seat cover is hard to install.,4
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","This is a product that a new father cannot live without.  We got it when my son was three weeks old, which in my opinion is three weeks late.  My son loves it and takes most of his daily naps in it.  We did not get it immediately because I didn't think it was necessary.  Well, I will admit I was wrong.  This is a must buy for all new parents.  Great quality and functionality.My only complaint, although I did not think it was a reason to reduce from 5 stars, is that the motor isn't silent on the one we got.  It knocks quietly when its running, but the knocking doesn't seem to both my son at all.  While I wish this would be fixed, its a non-issue performance-wise.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","With all the amazing reviews on this swing and the price of it, I admit my expectations were rather high.While my newborn did not like this swing outright, she eventually took to a liking and now it's an essential for her daytime naps.  That said, it works for us, but for the price, I have been anything but impressed and have often wondered if a cheaper swing would have worked just as well.Pros:- It's visually attractive.  The lights/mobile are nice and my baby is showing more interest in it since she was closer to two months.- It looks soft and comfortable for baby.- Lots of features: speed control, different sound options, lights/mobile options.- Ability to change the direction the swing faces is great for configuring to your liking within your space.- Ability to fold in legs so moving it from room to room makes it a little easier (it's still fairly bulky and awkward to move, though--this is NOT a portable swing, by any means).- I haven't used the battery option, yet, but I like that it is an option if I want to place the swing somewhere where an outlet is not convenient.Cons:- The first thing that struck me was how loud the motor is.  When we first turned it on, it sounded like frogs croaking.  I thought it was some weird nature sound that was on, but it turns out that's just how it sounds whenever you have the swing on.  I've since gotten used to it, but it's a bit obnoxious.- Six speed controls?  I hardly see a difference between 1 and 6, let alone 1 and 2, 1 and 3...  I honestly think the speed controls are just another selling point feature.  It doesn't seem to make much difference which speed setting you have it on.- Stability.  We have the swing on hardwood floor and when the swing is going, unless it just happens to be ""just right"", the feet tend to slide around and make annoying squeaking sounds because it will slide and move ever so slightly from the momentum of the swing (My baby is not even 10lbs yet, so I imagine when she gets heavier, this could potentially get even more annoying).  For this reason, it makes the construction seem a little bit weak and cheap.- I haven't used the tray yet, but based on how my baby fits in the swing and the angle, it seems awkwardly positioned and it looks like when you put it on, it becomes semi-permanent in the sense that you need to snap it off and on each time you want it out of your way.  There's no hinge or easy unlock.All in all, I'm pleased that my baby seems content in the swing during naptime, but for the price, I have to question whether there are options just as good.  Based on the plethora of complaints about it not lasting, it's certainly a concern for the future.  For now, that's not been a problem for us, but for one of the more expensive swing options out there, I expected a lot more while it is in new and working order.",3
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","Problem is with its motor. No matter on what speed i select out of 5 options...it swings/cradle at the same fast speed. Speed control is not working..it work as only on/off switch.Because of its FAST speed, my baby afraid to use the swing. Its completely useless for me...as it doesn't have noticeable speed differences.Don't go for it...",1
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","Love the starlight effect, especially at night. I use it everyday and the baby loves it. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it's a little noisy when the swing is in motion. Will be using it until baby no longer needs it. I would definitely recommend it to other moms out there.",4
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I bought this for my new baby boy and it is awesome. The swing is very calming and has lots of amazing features. You can adjust the speed of the swinging which is great because as my son gets older, I can have him swing a bit faster. There are lots of sounds. The swing plays songs and has calming sounds like birds chirping. There is volume control.It also comes with a mobile that my son finds very amusing. The mobile consists of two stars and a teddy bear. The highlight of this swing in my opinion is the beautiful lights. Overhead, you can choose to turn on the lights and stars and moons will rotate above and on the baby. It's very pretty.My son can usually fall asleep in it or keep him entertained for at least an hour. It wasn't too hard to put together either. The swing can also be adjusted to move side to side or front to back to give baby a different scenery if you choose to keep the swing in one spot. There is padding to hold newborns head's so they don't tip to the side and hurt their necks.Another plus is that you can choose to use batteries or plug it in the wall. The swings colors can be used for both boy or girl. I had read in other amazon reviews that the swing had some purple in it, and I worried it would be more of a girl swing, but to me its a bit more on the blue side than a purple and there isn't much of this color on the swing anyway. It has more beige in it than the blueish/purple.Overall, I am very happy with this purchase and recommend it.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",my grandson love the light show and music and me for well now i have a safe place where he can rest and take his nap  thanks,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","The baby loves it, the new mom loves it.  It does everything it claims to do, and it does it well.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",I have bought two of these an they are awesome !! If I have to buy another one I'm going to buy another one just like this !!!,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",this was a really good buy bought it for my daughter in law i will be making more purchases just dont know yet what,4
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I bought this swing for my daughter for use when the baby sitter is at our home. She loves it! Another perk to the swing is that it is not hard to put together. I am not a person who put items together easily. However, I did it all by myself without alot of time being spent figuring things out. The box mentions that there are several speeds and music tones, but there is only one speed (it is not very fast) and I haven't heard 16 different songs yet. Now that she is 13.5 lbs the swing speed is slowing up and making a loud noise, but it doesn't seem to bother my daughter. I just hope it will survive to it's promised amount of pounds (30).",4
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",It's a great product. I bought it for my daughter when she was 2 months she's 5 months now and still using it for naps. Fisher price customer service is outstanding. When I got the swing the motor was too loud so I emailed fisher price and I got a new motor within a week or so. The swing is beautiful and my baby loves it. She always smiles at the butterflies and talks to them. The only thing is that the motor is pretty loud when you first turn it on and it would always wake up my daughter so I figured that if you push the swing before you turn it on it won't be as loud. In case you're worried how long your baby will fit in it! My baby is in the 98% for height she's a little over 2 feet and she's 16 lbs and fits in it just fine.,4
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","making lot of noise, and the song volume control not at all working properly, you have to play with it to get proper volume",3
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","Got this for our first child. She used it for about 6 months, and she loved it. It has been loaned to TWO friends of the family since, and their kids love it as well. We are very much looking forward to using this with our second child",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I was a bit pessimistic on getting this swing because of the cost...yikes! I ended up getting it from amazon on sale with free shipping for $114. The ability to plug this swing in and have batteries as a back up was one of the biggest pluses for me. My first child, a boy had a swing simmilar in the ability to switch from side to side and to front to back motions which is great when the baby gest a bit older. The swing does tilt way back which is great for newborns and preemie's so they can lie far back with no worries. I really wanted a ""girly"" swing because everything else I have it a bit boyish and this is deffinatly girly! Over all a great swing and worth the money...if on sale!",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","My son and daughter-in-law really like this, they said it keeps the baby entertained and puts her to sleep when needed.  I know the sleep mode works very well because it puts me to sleep when I listen to it!!!!",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",My baby loved this swing she would fell asleep and really loved the star lighting around it is a great swing at a really reasonable price we loved it,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","We love this swing, it was easy to assemble, our baby boy seems to like it so far. But there is one annoying thing about it. All gears except for the first make an annoying sound when swinging, especially when gearing up. Not a dealbreaker, but please Papasan Team... fix it in the next version!",3
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",This was given as a gift and the mom is ecstatic with it. It has light purple butterfly strobe lights that dance on the walls and ceiling when the the lights are off. The music choices are very soothing.  This is a favorite. I have purchased a second one as a baby gift. The fact that it can be plugged in makes it very convenient to use.,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","After researching and reading hundreds of reviews, I purchased this swing! It's a great swing. My only complaints (if I let it bother me) is that the motor is a little noisy and the tray is hard to put on/take off. It's a beautiful swing, with great features. My 2mo falls right to sleep in it! My favorite feature is the starlight!",4
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",It is so cute me and my husband could not wait for this to get here and when it did it was just as great as i expected it to be. I cant wait for our little girl to get here!,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",We loved this baby swing! It was great for our baby girl.  Not only is it soothing for her but also gives mommy and daddy a little break. When she was a newborn she fell asleep in it every time but now at five months she likes to watch the little bear orbit.  Now that she is older she doesn't stay in it too long because she is a lot more active but it is still something good to have.,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I recieved the Starlight Cradle Swing as a shower gift and have been using it for about 6 weeks now. This swing has been a life saver as this is my second child and I am unable to hold her all the time like I could with my son as he still needs attention from me too. I have only used the swing in the cradle (side to side) mode as I don't really have room to turn it to the swing mode with out my daughter staring at the wall. I have had no problems with the motor and the seperate swing levels work just fine for us. I usually only use the first or second setting as it does really get going on the higher settings. The motor is also fairly quiet and not loud at all like I have read in other reviews, yes you can hear it while its on but it's not distracting in any way. It has quite a few different music and sound settings and my daughter loves the sleepy time music and it usually puts her right to sleep. The star lights also keep her entertained and she loves watching them move around the canopy as well as watching the mobile move around. I also like that you have a choice of turning the lights off while still having the mobile moving. My favorite feature with this swing though is the fact that you can plug it in. I will never understand why more swings do not have a DC option as these things eat through batteries like nothing. I actually haven't even bothered to put batteries in my swing as it is just always plugged in and it does not have an automatic shut off when plugged in. The only thing I was surprised about with the swing is that it is pretty big but we're in a small home right now so those with more floor space won't have a problem. Also there is no seat adjustment and the baby can only really lay down. (The pictures online show the infant kinda sitting up but that isn't how the swing actually is.) I figure once my daughter starts really sitting on her own she might not like the swing as much since it doesn't adjust. All in all though I love this swing and would recommend this to anyone, best swing I've had and with two kids I used a few different ones in the past.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","This swing is amazing.We originally purchased the ""nature"" version of this swing at a garage sale before our baby was born, just to see if she liked it.  Best $10 ever!  But we started chowing through the D batteries, b/c she slept in it for every nap and all night long.  So we decided to purchase this version, since it plugs into the wall.  We used it for four solid months, and then suddenly it started going slower and slower, the music and mobile stopped working, etc.I called Fisher-Price, assuming we would be out of luck, but they were SUPER.  I had registered the product when we first purchased it, so they just verified our information, and shipped us out a new motor (the entire top part of the swing).  It was on back-order, so they did offer us the option of purchasing a new swing and then reimbursing us the cost, but we didn't mind waiting and luckily our baby transitioned to her crib just fine.We've had the new motor now for over 2 months and it works flawlessly.  Baby still naps in her swing a few times a week and she loves the pretty stars and moons pattern, all of the music, and will now giggle and play in the swing vs. just napping in it.  I highly recommend this product to all of my friends who are about to become parents.  It is truly a lifesaver and as far as I'm concerned, Fisher-Price's customer service cannot be beat!",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",Love it and do does baby!  Love that it can swing front to back and side to side.  The music and calming sounds are great.  It was fairly easy to put together. .. my 6 year old helped me.  I like that the mesh curtain and the &#34;SNACK BAR&#34; are removable.  The best feature is that it has a power adapter and I don't have to use batteries unless the power goes out our something.  Price was great as well.,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","Swing is very cute! Works great. Baby is 8 weeks old and is very content in this swing. She sleeps in it for hours and the papasan is very comfortable with good head support. Rocks two ways, but you have to phyically pivot the swing to make it sway the other way. Lights and butterfly mobile keep her interest. Would definitley recommend.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","in the photo the swing looks blue, its actually a light purple colour sorta lilac. also the sounds arent very clear and the lulabies are very simerliar. not that impressed all in all. i was very excited when i saw the swing but when it was delivered it wasent what i thought it would be. but it does the job, bub seems to like it.",3
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","excellent product, sends baby off to sleep / entertained which enables me to do housework, best baby product i have - wish i had it with my first baby!!!!",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","We have had this swing a little over a month now, I have a 4 month old. For some reason the swing is slowing down I'm not sure if it's because of weight gain, I know it holds up to 25 lbs but my son is only 15.14 so I just don't know. I do like the mobile it distracts the baby for about 10 minutes. He doesn't really care for the music. A big negative is that the head rest doesnt come off. I like the swing but the baby doesn't really care for it, I'm not sure if he's uncomfortable or he just wants to be held.",3
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I bought this for my son and daughter in law for their first baby... We returned it. My granddaughter was born only 6 lbs, but she was not lying in it well. She was kind of shlumped in. And the swing went REALLY REALLY fast. I would never put a newborn in something that went so quickly.  The supplier was amazing- it was an easy and quick process. Disappointed we had to return -",1
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",We are Very pleased with this swing. We Would like to have had electric option with this papasan baby swing. Baby loves it so much we burn through batteries like diapers.,4
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",I do not like this product at all.  It's not very safe and the tray is a real inconvenience.  My 2 month old son fell out of it when I was about to fasten the tray in.  I was lucky he was not hurt because I was there to catch him.  I do not recommend this product.,1
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","We love this swing. It keeps my newborn busy for some time. This is the only place -aside from grandma's arms- that he takes a daytime nap. Everywhere else, he wakes up every 10 minutes. My only complaint is that you can't remove the head support. It makes my baby's head tilt down. I am always worried that he won't be able to breathe. I try to prop him up higher so this does not happen. If he were taller (he is 21 inches now), this would not be a problem. Otherwise, it would have been 10 stars.",4
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","This review is for the My Little Lamb cradle n swing.My son has never been able to sleep a full night in his crib.  He just hates lying completely flat.  he would last about 45 minutes and wake up, even in the middle of the night.  So we started putting him right next to the bed in the matching lamb vibrating seat and that worked like a dream until he was about 2 months old.  After he stared boycotting the seat, we bought the lamb swing and started putting him in that.  he LOVES it!  I wrap him in a Miracle Blanket (legs out for the harness) and lay him all the way back and he falls asleep in less than a minute.  I turn the swing off after 15 minutes (saves on batteries.)  he naps twice a day - 2 hours each - and sleeps through the night.He's 6 months old now and fairly light (about 13 lbs.) and the swing is still working perfectly (knock wood.)  The only time it stops swinging is when the batteries run low.  and i usually know when the batteries are on their way out bc the swing starts clicking.i've given this 4 out of 5 stars bc i have 2 problems.the sounds and music are really annoying (chirping crickets and such) so i actually put the vibrating seat UNDER the swing and play that music instead.  we've gotten so used to it that even my husband and i fall asleep to it now.and my son sleeps with his head to the side (like most babies do) and sometimes i'll wake up in the middle of the night and see that his face is half in the pillow.  not buried or anything (he can still breathe) but it makes me nervous.  so i gently touch his face and he shifts it so it's facing upwards.  i sleep with one eye open anyway, so it's not too much of a hassle, but i really wish that the pillow was smaller and fit only under his head, not stretching out to either side.",4
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","This swing is my best friend.  I have a 12-pound one-month-old who is collicky, and this not only relieves my aching arms (from carrying and holding her--which is sometimes the only way that I can calm her) but is also sometimes the only way that I can get her to nap in the afternoon.  It's true that the motor is somewhat loud; however, I almost always have the music playing for my daughter anyways, and that seems to drown out the sound of the motor if you adjust the volume of the music to a higher level.  It's also true that this swing is very pink and feminine, thus why we have come to call it the ""princess swing,"" but I receive many comments from friends and family about how cute this swing is.  My daughter loves all of the songs and sounds, as well as the lights.  But, what I love about this swing (aside from the fact that it quiets my daughter) is that you are able to use it with batteries or plugged into the wall (which saves on batteries!)--an option that you'll find on very swings.  My only real complaint is that the middle part of the seat is not as cushioned as the sides or head-rest, so I put a plush blanket down to make it more cushioned in that area.  Despite that, I highly recommend this swing and think that you'll find it to be your best friend too!",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",I bought this as a gift to my niece.  She loved it but quickly grew out of it.  This was an awesome swing thing.  I think it lights up and gives a light show and it plays a lot of different nursery songs.  Worth the money.,4
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",Swing design and looks fine but little bit noisy  so if you sensitive to sound and share room with your kids then i will suggest to other one with less noisy.,3
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",My almost one month old loves this swing.  He first used it at about a week old and the feel and music were very soothing.  Now he is able to watch the stuffed toys move around and seems to enjoy it even more.  There are so many great featured to this swing and I love that it can be plugged in.  Very easy to put together also.  Worth every penny!,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I bought this as a gift for my niece's new baby girl because she is the only great niece in the family, the rest are all boys, but I love them all.  But this swing set was so pretty, I knew she would love it for her new bundle of joy.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","My daughter has been using this a little over a month now. She LOVES the butterfly lights. I needed something that had music that ran longer too. Awesome product (and easy to put together, I did it without my husband's help)",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","This cradle swing is so versatile! Side to side or front to back options, with nice music options and lights. The motor noise...totally different story! This thing is soooo loud!! I initially thought something was wrong with it, but after I finally read some reviews I realized that this is just how it is. Our baby has severe acid reflux, is considered ""colicky"", and likes to keep ""moving."" This swing has allowed us to have some hands free minutes throughout the day and she tends to have an easier time calming down if placed in the swing when she's crying really hard. It isn't a miracle by any means (her GI doctor, pediatrician, and western medicine are closer to a real miracle), but she seems to find this swing soothing. When she is awake, alert, and feeling good, she seems to enjoy the lights, music, and the butterflies that go around in a circle at the top. Overall, this was money well spent and I'm glad I made the purchase!",3
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","The swing is very pretty. Although, the motor seems to have slowed in the 2 1/2 months that I've had the swing. It does not seem to swing as far (it did not swing very far to fast in the first place). I like how you can adjust the back to lay down for when my little one is asleep, but the upright position does not seem enough upright. My daughter gets frustrated and tries to sit up more to reach her toys. I also don't like how the music button and the light/butterfly rotate button are different. One you push to the end to turn off, the other you push to the middle. I always push both to the end, and the lights are left on. I wish the buttons were made the same.",3
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","It's been more than a month since I bought this swing. My baby boy is 2 months old now and he sleeps comfortably. He likes the star lights and how smooth it swings. If you wonder whether the star-lights come on to baby's' face, no they don't.The problem I am facing is that the volume knob does not work properly. It makes buzzing when i turn the knob and sometimes even if I minimize the volume, music is still loud.And, I can't really tell the difference between the six speed settings. First two settings feels different, but rest of the settings swing just like the second setting.If you think you would return a broken unit, think again. It's packed VERY tight in its box, so when you take it out, it's literally impossible to repack it! You need a box twice the size of the one it came in in order to return it! So you would probably settle with the one you got.Oh and one last thing, it makes a sound when it swings, coming from the electric motor. It's sounds kinda like a frog. It doesn't bother the baby but it may bother you a bit if you'd like take a nap too.",3
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I have a colicky baby and when I can't get her to calm down, I place her in this swings and within minutes she stops. She loves the lights above and stares at them, they even put her to sleep with music also playing. Some babies don't like swings but mine does, I would recommend this for the ones that like them.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",This swing has been a great comfort for my granddaughter. After placing her in this swing with the music she sleeps very soundly.,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","This swing is the place where my baby naps.  She loves it.  As a busy mom of three (two toddlers and a 8 week old) this is a great place for her to be away from the kids but still see what's going on.  Even though she is still young she loves the mobile (haven't put the tray on yet).  The cushy soft fabric is wonderful, and easy to remove if you need to wash it.  Another bonus is the mirror on the mobile my baby coos and smiles at it.  She loves her swing when she is awake.The only bad part is the music does shut off on its own.  Also, For the first week this swing was a bit too fast for our baby even on the lowest setting-after that she loved it.  Also, I dislike that their is no option to plug in the swing. I think that having both battery, and plug in outlet option would be nice.  Overall this is a great swing.  I look forward to seeing how she likes this swing as she gets bigger.  I will say not all babies like swings-you might want to try a friend's first to make sure that yours will before spending the money.",4
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I don't hate it but I don't love it.First con, Simply put I wish it had more incline/recline positions than just two, once baby's start wanting to try to sit up more (like my now 4mo old) they don't want to recline in a swing. This swing has no option to sit up straight..only recline and semi straight.Second con is it's huge. I even feel silly carrying this thing from one room to another.Third con is the stuffed animals hanging on top are angled outwards more for the look of the product, the baby can't see it very well.Fourth con is the head rest should be removable, it's not able to move up high enough so I had to cut it off.. and my son isn't even tall on the scales.Other than that the swing hasn't failed on me and the speed is fine. I wished it went slower when he was a newborn but now he's fine. Happy it has a power cord as well. I wished I would have went to the store to really look in person at these instead of going off reviews.. but it's making do.",3
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",I wanted to get a swing that:- Plugged in or used battery- Had music (especially either classical or nature)- Had a mobile- Was upholstered for comfort- Had good reviews... so I read everything I could find and decided on this one b/c the only two negatives I could find were that it wasn't blue it was purple. (It is actually mostly cream with accents in a shade between light blue and lavender) and that it was noisy to run. You can hear the engine when running it if you don't turn on the sound but it is not that bad and I am picky. I get annoyed listening to my dishwasher or washing machine. My six week old son likes it most of the time and it helps me to get a few things done around the house.BTW VERY few swings can be plugged in or use a battery. I didn't want to be stuck at home with a swing that didn't work b/c I needed to ruplun to the store to get batteries.,5

Fisher-Price Long Distance 900MHz Monitor,"I've owned 3 baby monitors and hadn't found one that even came close to the range it advertized. This one DOES! It's clarity is excellent. It even picks up my office wall clock ticking sound. I haven't had to replace batteries yet, and I've had it for two weeks, and use it 8 hours a day (minus weekends). And the nightlight feature is surprisingly useful. It has four channels but I have yet needed to switch from it's default channel. I'm able to go 3 houses down the street, and still get great clarity.I'm a sucker for good design (being an engineer myself), and I only have three minor criticisms. One is that battery installation requires a tool (small screw driver). The second is that the belt clip could be more secure...It's a tad floppy wearing jeans. This third criticism isn't a real criticism, but more of a 'wish'...and that is, ""I wish it had headset capability, so I could mow/weedwack/etc and still hear the monitor"".Great monitor, and great price too.",5
Fisher-Price Long Distance 900MHz Monitor,"I own the 800ft range version of this, which I am sure has little to no differences besides a slight increase in range. The base station unit is very small, very easy to place, very easy to setup and use in general, and has excellent audio pickup. My unit even has an amber colored LED based nightlight on top that you can switch on or off by a push. Nice!The receiver unit somehow manages to impress me even more than the base. It's TINY, it runs on batteries or included AC adapter, has 5 LEDs to indicate intercepted audio level, and the speaker level and clarity does quite nicely. Also, it has a belt clip that comes off very easily if you don't want to use it.The system has four 900mhz channels to choose from. I've only had this thing less than a day, so I can't yet verify the claims of distance nor can I attest to longevity of the units.Two downsides I'd like to comment on, before I digress into what can be done to these devices to make them BETTER.First, the base is corded... Meaning the adapter is hardwired to the unit. I don't like that, because I like to take my electronics to whole new levels for one, and for two, if the adapter dies... you don't just replace it... you find one that matches the voltage requirements and then you have to do some cutting and twisting of wire at the very least. That didn't impress me at all, but then after what I did to my base unit, it's a non issue anyway.The second thing I don't really like is the receiver using AAA batteries. For one, AAA cells don't have NEARLY the lifespan of AA cells, and for two, I wish it used AA's because that's what almost all my stuff uses. I picked things to be this way on purpose - I like universiality. ;-) It wouldn't have been a tough thing for them to build it to use AA's, it would have had a much longer runtime, and it wouldn't have that badly increased the size of the already absolutely tiny receiver.Now on to the fun stuff. I got this thing not to monitor children, for I have none, and not for chickens, for I have none of those either. I got this to MODIFY, whee hee! And for those of you who are interested, let me say this thing is EASILY modified. It took me less than two hours to open up the base, desolder the hardwired power adapter, and install an LM317 based 6.5 volt regulator circuit with a very common 5.5mm DC power jack. The whole operation went buttery smoothly, I must say, and now my base unit will accept anything from 5 - 15 volts with NO problems other thar than a little warmth and probably a little higher current drain. I now have a base unit that will run on any of the hordes of easily and cheaply available DC adapters (think thrift store or yard sale) and in point of fact runs brilliantly on a car cigarette lighter adapter and is running GREAT out on my porch at this very moment on a small four cell AA pack. CORDLESS, baby! I can now plant my base unit anywhere, even leave it outside on a regular basis with a little weatherproofing say from a plastic ziplock baggie or such as that. God do I wish I'd had one of these when I lived in the country in the hills of Tennessee... I could have used this to listen to the local wildlife from the comfort of the indoors whenever I liked. Anyways... distance testing comes tomorrow, I'll be running it on a stronger 6 cell pack for full range and distance testing it thoroughly.Just in case some of you think this is a crazy useless idea... consider the applications:Fully cordless operation on batteries, perfect for power outages or monitoring areas with no AC receptacles.Easy replacement with any common center positive DC adapter with the proper polarity, plug type, and voltage range.MUCH greater spread of potential uses, including easy monitoring of areas outside the home like porches, garages, barns, sheds, wildlife of the two or four legged variety... the list goes on and on. I plan to modify another and keep one for whatever use comes along, and the other will likely be placed permanently in my car to monitor it against breakin or vandalism when I am home and not watching it (who has the time to waste on watching their car, even in a rough neigborhood?). The second I hear any suspicious noises over the receiver, I can go to my window to see what's up. Paranoid? Not at all... last spring I discovered that my car was being used as a worktable by some people that were moving out and didn't care what they did around here anymore.One could even use a pair of these as a type of intercom between two areas, exploiting the four channels to create a full duplex audio link. The more I think it over, the more ideas I get. :-)Anyway... bottom line is these are GREAT little room monitors, and have great potential with a little hacking. Very affordable, very easy to use, and great features, and so far great reception. They have my vote.UPDATE:It's now been 11 days since I bought this thing and modified it, and now I know a LOT more about them, and have more deeply modified both the base and receiver.1) The receiver unit has inside it a tiny potentiometer for squelch adjustment. I found that my receiver was prone to cutting off when there was still plenty of signal to be had, IE, I could get more range. SO, I set my squelch adjustment to completely OFF. No more annoying ""BEEEP BEEEP"" even when signal is GONE, and if you're willing to put up with a bit of static, you can get a LOT more distance.2) I increased the transmit power by adding a very simple PN5179 transistor RF amplifier between the antenna output and the antenna itself. I have probably gained about .1 - .25 watt, enough to be quite noticeable, and harmonic output is still very low. Bear in mind this no doubt violates FCC regs, so do this at your own risk or not at all.3) I did fairly extensive distance testing both before the power increase and after, and have found this unit to perform quite impressively especially in open air conditions. During my field tests BEFORE the power boost, I placed the transmitter on the passenger seat of my car and went walking with an AOR8200 MKII scanner, and found excellent reception in excess of 200 feet (that's through car sheet steel, mind you), and after the power modification I found excellent reception as far away as 300 - 400 feet with the exact same environment and positioning of car and transmitter. If I am indeed to expect 800ft of distance from the stock transmitter, which I believe, then this modification should be getting me as much as 1600ft in the open air. I have not tested this, but I have reason to believe it is true.4) I have since tested the base unit on various power sources, from a four pack of AA NiMH cells to an 8 pack of AA NiMH cells, as well as 12VDC from AC adapters and my car cigarette lighter socket, and have found only the four-AA pack to be wanting, as it only provides 5VDC or just over, and the base now uses 6.5VDC. Temperature inside the case seems to be more than reasonably low, and current drain appears to be less than 50mA no matter how I power it.5) Before the squelch adjustment, I had sporadic losses of signal and difficulty at times in reaquiring signal once lost. After the squelch mod, needless to say, it never cuts out and I have had NO problems of any kind with either the base or the receiver.6) Inside the base unit is a tiny potentiometer that adjusts the microphone level. I was surprised to find that it was set near middle and had MUCH more available gain if I so chose to set it that way. It's my feeling that the stock setting is already a little hot, so I didn't increase it but a hair to make it more suitable to use for detection of subtle noises, for security type situations and the like. In a very noisy environment, I believe this pot could be set much lower for much better clarity in the received audio, although I have not yet tested this theory.Have fun! :-)NR",5
Fisher-Price Long Distance 900MHz Monitor,"We purchased the Fisher-Price Long Distance 900MHz Monitor for our new baby's room.  Like all Fisher-Price products, this has very simple and durable form factors.However, though it looks like a toy (and therefore fits right in with a small child's room), it is packed with reliable technology.  The ""broadcast"" base has excellent gain -- we have it on a shelf *across* the room from the crib, with no loss of sound quality or coverage.  The wide, flat base also doubles a large ""night light"" that can be turned on or off.The single remote receiver has an integrated power and volume dial, so it is extremely easy to use.  It also has a series of red LEDs that show the strength of broadcasted sounds, giving a visual as well as audio cue when the baby cries.  It has a sturdy belt clip built into the casing.Our home is brick, and our lot nearly an acre -- but the signal strength has been excellent everywhere we've taken the receiver.  With four different ""channels"" to choose from, we have had no interference from our other wireless devices (e.g., cordless phones, network wi-fi access point, etc.).I highly recommended this device for parents who want peace of mind, and can make-do with a single receiver.",5
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan Infant Seat Nature's Wonder,"This was just as I had hoped for and as advertised. Very comfortable for baby. Have a 21 month old , so I use this to keep baby out of curious hands for a while. Seems to fit newborns better than regular seat. It is a little wide for some doors, so have to take baby out to go into some rooms. But other than that, I am very pleased.",5
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan Infant Seat Nature's Wonder,"I absolutely love this infant seat.  The music is so sweet and pleasant to listen to, unlike most of the other baby products that have a more annoying electronic sound to them.  The plush seat is soft and comfy, and my daughter has enjoyed this since she was about a week old. Some people complain that it doesn't do enough, but that is what I like about it.  This infant seat is meant to be soothing --she can relax in this chair.  (I bought the Flutterby Bouncer as an alternative for when she wants more stimulation -- it's cute and relatively inexpensive.)  I highly recommend the baby papasan -- I wish they would make one for me.",5
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan Infant Seat Nature's Wonder,This was great but I had an issue with the fact that my child's legs were hanging off the edge...even as a newborn.I liked the little mirror and the bunny. The music and vibrations were obviously what we were looking for and this was fine for that. Just the length was an issue. I have tried others and didn't have the same problem.,3
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan Infant Seat Nature's Wonder,"I recommend this chair for sleep-deprived parents looking for a solution for their equally sleep-deprived infant who won't sleep in their crib or bassinet.My son refuses to sleep for more than a few minutes at a time in his bassinet right now (he's seven weeks old).  I bought this chair a week ago and both of us have gotten more sleep this week than in weeks past.  It cradles him nicely in the included infant body support and his head rests perfectly in the head support.The fabrics are soft, but not too soft, and the vibration feature is just right.  My son doesn't react either way to vibration a lot of the time, but it does help sometimes.The only real drawbacks to this infant seat are its length and its lack of volume control.  Thankfully, my son fits into the seat nicely, but his feet are coming close to the edge of the chair and he will grow out of it in the next few months.  Also, while there is no volume control, the music isn't that loud.  So it could be worse.I will kind of miss the chair when he does grow out of it and goes to his crib!",4
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan Infant Seat Nature's Wonder,"My son had GERD (reflux) and needed to keep his head elevated during naps and sleeping.  We had been given one of these as a gift and the baby was very comfortable in it.  Our doctor told us that this was a better place to have him sleep than our crib.  We got one for daycare, too, and all the babies there are very comfortable in it.  He used it until he outgrew it, which was about 1 1/2 years.  We have another baby due soon and will be using this faithfully again.p.s.  I wish this came in adult size, as it looks so soft and comfy!",5
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan Infant Seat Nature's Wonder,"Although I think this seat looks comfy and is nice looking, it didn't work for our baby.  I bought it after reading all of the reviews.  I think it looks better to adults than it really is for infants.  Our daughter never liked it, and I tried it over and over.  It was never better for her than lying on a mat on the floor (or in her crib.)  It's not a bad design, but just didn't work for us.  We ended up with the Aquarium infant seat and the portable aquarium swing (both Fisher Price.)  I do agree with reviewers that the music is very clear on the Baby Papasan as compared to other infant seats/toys.",3
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan Infant Seat Nature's Wonder,"We originally bought a papasan seat for our oldest daughter in 2006.  She still sits in it occasionally, and was perfect (before she got too big) for sleeping elevated when she was sick.  When we found out we were expecting our 2nd daughter I knew that another papasan would be perfect!Such a life-saver!",5
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan Infant Seat Nature's Wonder,"I bought this directly from the Fisher Price website for I believe the $35- $40 range on sale.  I like it just fine.  It fits easily in my bathroom and I can put the baby in it while I take a shower.  She can get by 15 minutes with no vibration or music until she gets bored.  Then she will get by with 15 minutes of vibration and music before she gets bored again.  By that time, I am showered and dressed.  I wouldn't pay the regular price for it though.",4
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan Infant Seat Nature's Wonder,"For a brand new baby, this chair really served a purpose.  It gave us a secure and comfy place to put our daughter so that she could be up at the table with us.  She liked pulling the little velcroed toy off the toy arm.  She never got into the vibration, and this chair never helped her calm down.  She never napped in it.  It was just a really handy place to put her so that we could eat.  She started trying to sit up pretty early, and we realized this chair wasn't safe anymore.In the end, I wish we'd gotten a bouncer for her.  I think it would've lasted longer and done more to soothe her.",3
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan Infant Seat Nature's Wonder,"When I was first shopping for a bouncy seat, I passed this one by because it doesn't actually bounce.  I also wanted one with more interactive features to entertain the baby.However, when my baby was a few weeks old it became apparent that he would not sleep in his bassinet - only the bouncy chair.  As relieved as I was for him to finally sleep, I was somewhat nervous as the bouncy chair was long and narrow and didn't seem right for him to sleep in long-term.  I ran across this papasan chair and decided to invest the money and give it a try - and I love it!Since it's round and a little deeper I feel a lot more secure with him sleeping in it beside my bed while I sleep.  He seems more comfortable in it as well - he even has somewhere to prop his arms.  It has these wonderful carrying handles so I can safely take him from room to room while he naps.It's true that the music/vibrations shut off after 15 minutes but that hasn't caused me any problems at all.  He also enjoys the detachable mirror and bunny rabbit toy while he's awake - many times I've glanced over and caught him enraptured by his own reflection.This papasan chair has really saved my life since it's the only place my 2 month old will sleep at night!  I plan to use it until he is old enough to sleep in the crib.",5
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan Infant Seat Nature's Wonder,"This product is a 5 star all the way.  Our newborn, of 4 days has been given us minor fits at times so we place her in this little contraption.  Between the music and vibration it settles her in no time.  We actually have incorporated it into her every day activity now.A must have!",5
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan Infant Seat Nature's Wonder,"This seat was purchased on a whim, my 6 week old was being really fussy one day, and my husband and I went to the store to get him a infant tub to see if that would sooth him. Then we came across this seat, which I had seen before and fell in love with it and decided to get it for him. Thinking it would help sooth him, because he loves to be cradled and loves to vibrate and this seat does both. So when we got home and put him in it he loved it and it soothed him, he sleeps in it all the time. We even put it in his pack and play and it fits perfect in there. The blanket on it is nice and soft, the only thing is it falls off of him a lot so I swaddle him in a blanket when I put him in it. We love this seat, I just wish I would have gotten it when they added the mobile to it, because he would have loved that! So to me you can't go wrong purchasing this seat, cause it really helped out a fussy baby!",4
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan Infant Seat Nature's Wonder,"I ordered this for my newborn and it's just ok. The biggest complaint I have is that it doesn't bounce at all. Which if I had read the description of the product better I would have noticed that. My child is two months now and I don't see him being able to fit in this two months from now. The leaf with the mirror hasn't been noticed by my baby. On the upside, he is pretty snug in the seat and it folds up nicely. I propbably wouldn't have bought this if I had it to do over again. I'd have looked for something else.",2
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan Infant Seat Nature's Wonder,We bought this seat for my daughter and it was a life saver! The music and vibration would always calm her down when she was fussy. This is a must have!,5
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan Infant Seat Nature's Wonder,"I don't know what I would have done without this! My son wouldn't sleep anywhere else except for this chair the first few months of his life. He LOVES the vibrating. I also like that you can choose music and vibrating or just one or the other. It also shuts off automatically after a while, which is great.He's almost 4 months old and he still loves it. I dread parting with it once he outgrows it.The only downer... he has a chubby belly and the belt that holds him in is getting tight. I wish it were longer.",5
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan Infant Seat Nature's Wonder,"We got the baby papasan as a shower gift, and we have loved it so far!  Our daughter is 5 months old, and she still loves to relax in it!  It's cozy and folds up really easily for storing.  It does tend to eat batteries if you use the vibrating seat option with the music, but it's worth it!  The cover is fairly easy to remove and wash, and overall, it's a great product!",5
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan Infant Seat Nature's Wonder,I bought this item for my first grandson over a year ago and I know it is well made and they used it extensively the first couple of months of his life.  As I have a new grandson on the way I purchased the same item knowing that it will be useful and safe.,5
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan Infant Seat Nature's Wonder,"My daughter was born prematurely and developed the typical GERD, which caused apnea episodes. Lying on her back was not an option as it aggravated the reflux and encouraged apnea episodes.Swings are generally out of the question when reflux is an issue (as well as being awkward when the baby is attached to a monitor.  THIS was the little seat the NICU and Pediatrics nurses would use for their reflux babies so this is what I bought for home, and my baby slept in it for the first four months.The angle is close to perfect to ease reflux (just add a rolled up washcloth in back of baby's neck to keep airway open optimally).  The gentle vibrations originate at the feet so GERD babies are lulled to sleep without being jostled or bounced.  The music is easy on adult ears, too.The cushion is one piece and comes off and washes easily.  I thought the light color would be hopelessly stained within the first two weeks, but even towards the end of her use of it, it looked brand new.A surprising benefit of this chair was that the transition from our room to her nursery was easy since I just put her - papasan seat and all - into the crib at night for a week.  She got used to the sounds of her own room from the familiarity of her seat.  When she could finally sleep on her back (on a crib wedge)in her crib, she was already used to the environment.",5
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan Infant Seat Nature's Wonder,This seat worked very nice for my newborn before she could start to focus with her eyes. It was very boring for her and she would cry. I went and got her the fisher price aquar. seat and she will sit for hours and watch the bubbles and fish. I would suggest buying a seat that has something in front of baby to watch.,3
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan Infant Seat Nature's Wonder,My husband purchased this bouncer for our son and I love it.  I have NEVER heard music come so clearly out of a bouncer.  We had the ocean wonders bouncer and it was so fuzzy that I had to shut it off.  And I was actoually pleasently surprised at the fact that we didn't go through battaries NEARLY as fast as I had predicted.  This allows me to get a shower by myself and my son to sleep.  It's really a lifesavor.,5
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan Infant Seat Nature's Wonder,"This is a wonderful bouncer for a preemie! Those of us you don't have the luxury of a ""normal"" baby need all the help when can get with our little miracles! No other bouncer is created with a preemie in mind.  Plus, I don't have to worry about my 2 year old bouncing him like a normal bouncer could do. He loves to be the big boy by turning on the bouncer. Even though it says maximum 20 pounds, my 40 pound 2 year old loves to sit in it. Another plus to this bouncer is it will put a fussy baby right to sleep. I agree the other bouncers are great for entertainment but sometimes a baby just needs to relax and not be over stimulated!!!",5
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan Infant Seat Nature's Wonder,"We received this as a gift for our first child. It was indispensible for the first 4 or 5 months, until he could move into the swing (another indispensible item!). We brought it back out for our second (she is 3 mo. now) and then purchased one for our friends who were having their first child. This is an awesome baby gift. It can be moved around the house very easily and has rubber feet that will grip any suface. We LOVE the vibration feature! We use it everywhere!! Dining room table, couch, on our bed. The babies seem to love it too!",5
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan Infant Seat Nature's Wonder,"I recieved this seat for my baby shower.  I still have 3 weeks left until my son is due.  I am so excited to put him in it.  I love how the company improved the seat.  I loved the older style, however I do prefer the hanging bunny to the velcro bunny at the side.  I was afraid my son would have trouble finding the bunny and inturn get frustrated.  I love the mirror globe above babies head so he will be able to look at himself.  I honestly can't wait to put my son in it.",4
Sassy Bath Time Tubby Tumblers Toy,"On the plus side, these tub toys are hard plastic with no holes so they float all of the time and don't fill up with nasty mildew water. My 15 month old constantly chews on them and the paint has yet to chip off.  The bad thing about this toy is it does not stack up (as shown in the advertisement) making them a little frustrating for my daughter to play with, and in my opinion aren't really worth $6.00.",2
Sassy Bath Time Tubby Tumblers Toy,they dont stay on top long enough for child to get a chance to enjoy ther accoplishment of building a tower but they are great bath toys and very cute,3
Sesame Street Holiday Cookie Monster 9&quot; by Gund,Bought as a gift for Christmas.  So soft and festive looking.  I know my niece will love this and add it to her ever growing Cookie Monster collection!!!,5
Crocodile Creek Barnyard Placemat,That's a great placematMy daughter loves to watch at the animals when waiting for her meals or when she is eating.,5
Crocodile Creek Barnyard Placemat,"This placemat is ok, but it has no grip or anything on the bottom, so my son just slides it all over the table...plate and all.  Why can't I find a placemat that has a rubber bottom so it won't slide?",3
Crocodile Creek Barnyard Placemat,This comanies placemats for kiddos are awesome.They are very durrable.My kidds have a couple and they love to sit andpoint things out that they know or to ask questions.,5
Crocodile Creek Barnyard Placemat,"It is just a piece of sheet plastic. I thought placemats had to have some sort of texture on the back so that it sticks a bit to tables. Similar to suction cups, if you get what I'm saying. I mean, my cats placemats have that! This moves about all over the place. What is the point of that? I feel it was overpriced, but I guess I will use it. I am ... disappointed. Maybe I should have just got a cat placemat.",2
Crocodile Creek Barnyard Placemat,We use this placemat everyday.  It's easy to clean and our toddler loves it.  Our only issue with it is that it slides very easily along the table surface.  This can lead to some serious messes.  Wish it had a little more stability or a bottom that gripped the table a little better.,3
"Vilac Pull Toy, Fanfan The Elephant","Loved the color and look of this pull toy but in reality it is quite small, and very prone to tip over which is frustrating to ones just walking along nicely. Smallness also lends to kids lifting it up and carrying it around instead of pulling.",3
Primo Ducka Toilet Set Reducer (White),"This seat is cute and makes for a fun incentive. However, it is much harder than the Bjorn seat to fit to your toilet seat. I almost cracked the entire seat trying to put in the safety pegs, before I ever used it. It still didn't fit my seat. I just use it without them. The feet on the duck are made of sticky rubber that helps keep it in place. I think the Baby Bjorn seat is better with the dial adjuster, it's just not as cute. I use the duck for the downstairs toilet.",3
Primo Ducka Toilet Set Reducer (White),"We ordered this based on reviews. We couldn't be happier. My son loves his ""ducky seat"". Very simple, no attachments, just sit on the toilet seat and your in business.",5
Primo Ducka Toilet Set Reducer (White),"At first I thought this was a great seat. It's cute, it matches my daughter's bathroom, and it fit my toilet perfectly. I would raise the seat and put it directly on my toilet so it wouldn't be too high for her. It was very stable and wouldn't move around at all. Once I realized my daughter was ready for full potty training, we started to use the seat constantly. She did a great job going to the potty in the beginning. She wouldn't complain or anything - she'd RUN to the bathroom for potty time! Soon however, I noticed she was uncomfortable and cried whenever it was potty time. I tried different things to get her to go, like painting her finger and toe nails, reading to her, singing, giving her little pieces of a Hershey's bar (her favorite) as a reward - nothing worked. She didn't like pottying anymore. On the third day of her potty training, I noticed two red ""carpet-like"" burns on the inside of her thighs. Well no wonder! I think the problem was a combination of two things; she's petite (25 months old, 24"" tall & 24 lbs.) and the way she sat on the seat. I think the width of the duck's head might've had something to do with it too. Whatever the reason, the seat quickly lost its appeal. I replaced it with a Munchin Deluxe Potty seat and that did the trick. My daughter is back to pottying - comfortably!This seat is really cute, has some pretty great ratings, and both kids & parents seem to like it. It just didn't work for us and I thought I should share that problem with other parents. In my opinion, this seat isn't made for petite toddlers!",3
Primo Ducka Toilet Set Reducer (White),holds steady. does not slide.  easy to clean.  it does cause my toddlers legs to be a bit red after sitting but so does the other floor based potty chair.,5
Primo Ducka Toilet Set Reducer (White),"After lots of unsuccessful attempts at potty training with a singing potty and other tools and tactics, it was the duck that finally got my son to sit on the big boy toilet and pee.  It's comfortable, the front lip is high enough that it prevents him peeing over the seat (which he did on the little potty the few times he used it).  It's portable and super easy to take on and off.  So now at 28 months, he's using the toilet every day.  The down side is that if I try putting him on another seat now, he refuses and demands ""pato"" (Spanish for duck).  Oh well, I guess I'll just have to carry the duck around until he's 5!  Anyway, great product and I just ordered a second one to keep at Grammy's house.  Absolutely worth the couple of extra ducks (oops, I mean bucks)!",5
Primo Ducka Toilet Set Reducer (White),"This is truly the best potty seat out there.  We had the little potty chair that sings after you ""make a deposit"", but my daughter was always bothered by the fact that it asks you to flush, but the flush isn't real.  And I was beginning to be bothered by cleaning out the poo.  It was time to switch to the big toilet, but the falling in factor made her nervous.  We tried one of those cheap cheats with the little air cushion, but they wiggle around and just don't feel safe.  I had wanted one with the ladder, but didn't want to wait weeks or months for the product to come back in stock, so after reading the reviews here, I ordered this seat.  My daughter fell in love with it at first sight, and has never even looked back at her little potty chair.  We dealt with the climbing issue by putting her pink baby bjorn step stool at the base of the big toilet.  She steps up on the step stool, turns around and scoots backwards onto the duck.  There is nothing negative to say about this seat.  It fits perfectly, it feels stable and doesn't wiggle around, she says it is comfortable, and it's a breeze to clean and store.  It has a little loop at top and we hang it right next to the big potty.  My daughter loves this seat, she pretends the duck talks, and she says he protects her from falling in.  I wish I had bought this months ago.  Thank you Primo for making this.  You have made using the toilet safe and fun (how funny to be excited by a potty seat, but that's just one of the many joys of parenthood, the best job in the world!).",5
Primo Ducka Toilet Set Reducer (White),"The PRI Ducka toilet seat was a gift for my sons second birthday. He has just started expressing curiosity in terms of using the &#34;big boy potty.&#34; He is attracted to the large eyed duck and is comfortable on the seat itself. We have it hanging on a hook next to our toilet which makes for convenient and easy access. I can simply place it onto the toilet and help him onto the potty. The seat does not have handles, however the sides are shaped in a way that make them perfect for little grabbing hands to steady themselves on. The ducks head works well as a shield to keep urine from spraying outside of the toilet. I like the fact that my son can easily lift and place this seat himself. The price is on the higher end of comparable potty seats, however I believe that the money is well spent due to quality and design. In fact, I have purchased a second one for our upstairs bathroom!",5
Primo Ducka Toilet Set Reducer (White),This ducky and its emotional quotient (honey the ducky is crying because you didn't go potty on it :D) helped us potty train our toddler in 3 weeks flat. The duck sits snugly on our oval shaped seat and is deep enough to guard against spills (we have a boy). The rubber beak and flippers help keep it in place even with a squirmy toddler. Very easy to clean amd easy to stow or hang.,5
Primo Ducka Toilet Set Reducer (White),"We got the duck potty yesterday in the mail.  My 2 year old son was super excited about the duck part.  We opened it, immediately went to the bathroom, put it on the toilet (perfect fit on our elongated Kohler bowl even with no adjustment), he sat on it an pooped right away.  He was SO PROUD, to have gone on the big potty.  I'd call that instant success.  5 stars!",5
Primo Ducka Toilet Set Reducer (White),"This potty seat is great.  It fits on my elongated seat in one bathroom and the standard seat in the other.No need to use the pegs, this seat does not slide!  It is easy to clean and my 2 1/2 year old daughter loves it.I still use a potty chair for poopie because she will only sit on the big toilet for so long.Looking for a great potty chair...Fisher-Price Precious Planet Froggy Friend Potty.Kudos to the duck and priced right.  I got one for every bathroom and it hangs nicely on a hook we put on the wall just for this seat.",5
Primo Ducka Toilet Set Reducer (White),"I love this duck!  We got it as a gift and I am so grateful to the person who gave it to us.  My two year old son handles it all by himself and it really does ""stay put"" perfectly once it's in place.  The only down side is that the rubber ""handle"" on ours tore rather quickly, thus we can no longer hang it on its hook next tothe toilet.  Other than that, this has been one of those rare products that I'd do again in a heartbeat.",5
Primo Ducka Toilet Set Reducer (White),"This was the perfect solution for my niece. Every other potty we have purchased or looked at had been too much like a toy for her to take seriously, she would end up carrying them around filled with other toys or putting her stuffed animals on them to pretend but never used them herself. This is a nice balance of cuteness and functionality. It looks somewhat like a real adult toilet seat only smaller and more engaging thus she has approached its introduction in a completely different manner than before. We are using this directly on the porcelain and when not in use it goes on the shelf behind the toilet so she knows it is a bathroom only object. The seat itself is sturdy, it stays put without the pins, it is easy to wipe down or rinse in the tub and the duck design (I personally think it looks more like a penguin) is gender neutral so my nephew will be able to use it as well.",5
Primo Ducka Toilet Set Reducer (White),my 17month old grandson loves his new toilet seat.  the seat fits perfectly on the toilet and the design is comfortable for his little bottom.,5
Primo Ducka Toilet Set Reducer (White),"This is the best potty seat we have tried. Love the look of it and the splashgaurd does the job pretty well. You can secure it with plastic screws, but I found this unnecessary. (Plus I liked being able to easily grab it and rinse it after every use or so.)",5
Primo Ducka Toilet Set Reducer (White),"this seat is well made, fits our regular ole toilet seat, and my potty-training three-year-old and two-year-old fit perfectly on it. highly recommend it.",5
Primo Ducka Toilet Set Reducer (White),The seat arrived dirty looking. There are several spots on the bottom that looked like mold. The packaging looked faded and dingy. It is very disturbing to think my child is using a disgusting used potty chair. Ive tried cleaning it in the sink but all the spots are not coming off. There is no way the stability pins will ever fit in the holes but at least it doesn't move as much as other chairs I've tried.,1
Primo Ducka Toilet Set Reducer (White),Most parents dread potty training but I have to say having the Ducka made potty training easy and fun for our little boy.This is a great product and I highly recommend it!,5
Primo Ducka Toilet Set Reducer (White),"Let me qualify this by saying this is the only potty seat I've ever used.  It's absolutely WONDERFUL.  My son loves the duck.  It's got a very happy looking ""face"".  There are pegs on the bottom that fit into adjustment slots so the seat can be tailored to meet the dimensions of any toilet.  While it's easy to lift on and off the toilet, it doesn't move when my child is sitting on it.  The yellow at the base of the seat in the picture is rubber and extends all the way around the base, giving it non-slip security.  The back of the duck's head is tall to prevent little boys from peeing over the edge and it really works!  The seat is easy to clean without crevices to collect dirt. In all - you won't be sorry you purchased the PRIMO Ducka Toilet Seat Reducer.",5
Primo Ducka Toilet Set Reducer (White),The seat it very hard and bothers my two year old son if he sits on it more than a couple minutes. Will be purchasing one with more cushion.,1
Primo Ducka Toilet Set Reducer (White),"This is much better quality than most of the seats they had at Target when I went looking, and having been to many houses with toddlers and toilet adapters, I feel this is the best one I've come across.  It fits perfectly on our old-ish toilet, it's really sturdy, and doesn't move around, etc.  The hook is handy, it's easy to clean, it doesn't leak, and it's adorable.  We've had ours for more than a year now, and it's going strong.",5
Primo Ducka Toilet Set Reducer (White),My daughter loves the 'ducky' seat . . it fits securely on the toilet so there's no pinching or shifting and she can easily put it on and take it off by herself. Very happy with the product.,5
Primo Ducka Toilet Set Reducer (White),My son used it when he was getting potty trained and now I ordered it for my second child too..can't be a better product for elongated toilets! doesn't move..,5
Primo Ducka Toilet Set Reducer (White),"Perfect for every need. I adjusted the pins to fit snug on the toilet. My 2 year old can put it on, sit on by himself (with a step stool), and remove it after each use. Same great features as Bjorn, almost half the price! Duck is good entertainment while waiting to ""go"". Easy to clean with Clorex Wipes as well. No buyers remorse. It's just perfect.",5
Primo Ducka Toilet Set Reducer (White),"my son loves this potty, but he still is not trained! it is very cute and stays on the toilet well!",4
"Kaloo Doudou Plush Blankie, Mint","My daughter (2 1/2 yrs) received this toy as a gift when she was born and still carries it around with her everywhere she goes.  We've washed it a hundred times and, although faded from washing, still looks great!  I love toys that can be washed!",5
Flipper Gripper Rattle,"Love the rattle, it's the perfect size for our four-month-old to start learning to grab and hold.  But when I tried to wash it before he used it the first time, the clear ball in the middle got water in it.  It's been several days and it's still got condensation inside it.  It looks like it will EVENTUALLY dry, but I hope it won't have water spots all over the clear plastic ball.  The rattle is great, makes a neat noise, is the right size and weight, and easy for him to hold.  Just keep away from the water!!  Note, although description says there are two styles, we didn't get the opportunity to select, they just picked for us.",4
Infantino Go Go Rider Carrier in Navy/Blue Plaid,"It is kind of cumbersome to put on but baby seems more or less comfortable. Was great for facing in, but once she started facing out she was too heavy to carry comfortably without my back hurting so I rarely use this, only in situations where we are out and about without my husband and I think the place may be crowded and I want to keep her very close to me(people tend to want to be touchy feely with my baby)",3
Kushies Zolo Boa,"My daughter has been playing with this toy from a month old. it is colorful, soft, and each piece makes interesting sounds that makes my daughter smile. She is a year now and still loves it. Well made. I love the fact that it is washable.",5
Kushies Zolo Boa,"This company has lots of toys that are unusual and have great concepts.  I love the toy and my daughter seems to like it okay.  The rings are stacked on a stick and it may have been more helpful and my daughter may be more interested in it if the stick was free standing and she could just stack the rings on it.  But when all the rings are off the stick, it's just a cloth stick and my daughter seems to only be interested in the stick right now.  She does try and poke the stick through the center of the rings but hasn't gotten how to push the rings down and stack them.  Maybe they should have made not only the stacking stick free standing but the holes a little bigger on the rings so babies can easily stack the rings on. Maybe my daughter will be more interested in the toy later.  She's 12 months now.",3
Kushies Zolo Boa,"Not a fun toy of a 6 month or a 9 month old.Not easy for a baby to get the rings to make the animal noises (tried at 6 months and at 9 months). Never &#34;giggles&#34; at the end when all the rings are stacked. A nice looking toy because the colors, but that is it. Definitely not worth $40.00.Get a leap frog table instead, or your better off buying your child books.",1

Mommy's Helper Slide Latch,"I bought these specifically for our entertainment/tv stand and that is the cabinet it DOES NOT work with (see pictures), but it is GREAT with the right kind of cabinet that has handles rather than round knobs - easy to open and close (I have it on our kitchen island cabinet and our microwave cart) for an adult but seems great to keep a little one out (our son is 7 months and has been crawling EVERYWHERE for the past few weeks but isn't opening cabinets YET). I would buy it again, just not for a cabinet with round, smaller knobs.",4
Mommy's Helper Slide Latch,"These aren't very rigid and seem like they could break easily, but they have kept our 1 year old son out of the cabinets so far. Easy for the adults to get in and out of the cabinets without too much hassle.",4

They really are a must have if you use the Dr. Brown's wide neck bottles. I have twins and we go through several bottles a day. I discovered these when my boys were already 10 months old. I wish I had known about them sooner. They REALLY ought to included with the bottles, just like the handy cleaning brush and the travel disc; just all standard. Oh well. Maybe Dr. Brown's will read this review...",5

Pump in Style Advanced Breastpump Limited Editon 57028,I am a new mom and a firefighter/paramemdic. I bought this pump because I started to dry up and my other pumps were not doong it for me. They were also very hard to take to work with me even with their carring case. The case for this pump hold everything it comes with and then some. The guys at work didn't even know what it was. And the freezer case hides my breast milk which my coworkers like. the pump does the same job the the Symphony pump at the hospital did. I am very pleased with this item.,5
Medela Pumping Free Hands-free Breastpumping Kit,I bought this to go with my medela breat pump (great pump by the way).  This greatly relieved soreness in my breasts and allowed me to pump both breasts at the same time which saved time. I did feel a bit like a milk factory though..,5
Medela Pumping Free Hands-free Breastpumping Kit,"you don't need the whole kit. only the loop and latch is needed. if you use the plastic, it gets really heavy and you end up holding it anyway.  you just loop the rubber bands to the connector and then attach the tubing.  this way, you can use the softfit breastshield too.",5
Tiddliwinks Blue Transportation Flecked Blanket,I searched the internet for another Tiddliwinks sage blanket as I am not sure they make this one anymore.  It is soooo soft and one of my twin daughters has become so attached to hers that I thought I better get a second just in case-she would go into shock if we lost it.  It washes well too.  It is my daughter's best friend.  I hope they make it again because it is a soft pretty blanket that I would recommend for a baby gift.,5
Cosco Funsport  Play Yard,I purchased this item for my 6 week old Chi puppy.  When I am unable to supervise him I put him it it.  He has his bed in one end and a puppy pad in the other end.  It works real well and we keep it in the living room at the time.  He is with the family and does not fuss when he's in it.  He is now 10 weeks old and will even bark when he wakes to go outside to do his potty duties.  I would reccomend the playyard to anyone with a very small puppy.  The price is also very good.,4
Safety 1st Travel System Ivy Cottage,"The stroller is lovelly as well as the infant car seat, we use the car seat since the day the baby born, to carry it, to hold, baby loves to sleep in the infant car seat because it prevent any gas after he has eat.The stroller is beatiful, easy to handle and also is to move because of the little weight.I totally recomend both items, of course you cant never leave a baby un attended but both products can help you to protect your baby when needed to take to a doctor, to a visit, to travel, to the garden or where ever yoy want to go with the baby.And the best is the low prices I pay for it.",5
Tiddliwinks Sage Jungle Character Fitted Sheet,"We bought a number of items from the Sage Jungle product line and we have been very happy with it. It is durable fabric, and a bright and cheery design.",5
Babylicious Happy Face Cloth Set,Quality wise they are good but small with very limited use and my wife hates that I spent $10 on it.,1
Kids II Portable Booster Seat,"I would not recommend buying this product.  The straps get lose on their own and the seat slides out of the chair.  Dangerous product, and it should be recalled!!",1
Kids II Portable Booster Seat,"I love this booster, the price is unbeatable and we've been using it for about a year and a half.As with any baby product, you should not leave your child unattended.  That being said, I've never experienced a problem with the straps loosening to a point where it would be a hazard.The one drawback is that this booster doesn't really work with rounded seats.  We had cheaper chairs with square seats for a while, and just refinished some 1920s queen anne chairs, the seat doesn't fit securely anymore.Love the product, would recommend to anyone!",4
Safety 1st Signature Integrated Travel System (Biltmore),"after checking it out moving things around open and close a few times took the seat out and put it back and I love it! Easy to use, very soft, and perfect for me but I'm 5'10""",5

Tiddliwinks Sage Jungle 4-pc. Crib Set,"This is beautifully designed bedding and we love the sage color. I have never used the quilt on my daughter, however. We use it as a decoration only.

Cosco Ventura DX Booster Car Seat,This cat seat is good but if you compare other car seats in similar price range then you will find better car seat then this. Also this car-seat is for 22-80 lbs. weight not for 20-100 lbs weight like other car-seats.,4
Cosco Ventura DX Booster Car Seat,"I purchased this car seat for my grandson to use when he's in my car. After looking at several models I chose this one because of the style,look, fabric and color which is just right for a little boy. My grandson of 22 months sits very tall and comfortable in this carseat. His whole body is secure even with the bulky winter clothing he needs to wear here in Chicago.  Thanks Amazon for a quick delivery and for your ease of shopping on your website. I will definately be ordering again!",5
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,"Good in theory, but it did absolutely nothing for my son and the velcro does not stick very well, so it had to be held on. A waste of my $20!! Would not recommend unless you simply want a heating pad for other reasons.",1
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,My son had a little bit of gas in the first two months  so I purchased this for when he had really bad gas and it definitely calmed and soothed him,5
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,"I ordered this out of desperation.  I think that it has been helpful for our now 1 month old.  I enjoy the scent, my husband says that it's a bit strong for him.  I microwave for 15 seconds, then wrap it on over her clothes, then swaddle her arms, and snuggle with her when she's screaming with gas pains, and usually within 1-2 minutes (sometimes shorter) she is much calmer (and quiet).  I don't use it a whole lot, only when everything else hasn't worked, so to reserve it for when we really need it.  I like it and would buy it again.",4
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,I liked the Happi Tummi concept... the warmth and the pressure really helped my son's colic (and helped to keep him warm during the cold winter months)  The only disadvantage for me was that it was too big for my kiddo...they need to make smaller ones for small babies and preemies.,4
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,"We've tried this a number of times and we just don't think it works (for our baby).  Of course, it's hard to know what's *really* causing a baby to cry frequently, so I was skeptical that it would work to begin with.  But one *should* buy this with a healthy dose of skepticism.  Of course, if you've got a baby that cries a lot, it's probably worth trying anything and everything.",1
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,Used it only a few times but it seemed to help when my baby had colic. Just be careful on how hot it is on their little belly. Always put it on top of clothes.,4
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,Saved our lives w our colicky baby! The heat and natural smells would soothe him when he would be inconsolable for hours! Recommend to all w babies w tummy issues or just to have on hand for the dreaded tummy problems --,5
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,my infant has a very sensitive tummy and this works wonders i put it in the microwave and put it on him at night and he sleeps well with his little tummy warm.,5
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,My infant son is content when he's wearing this waistband. I have never had a problem with overheating/burns; the lavender scent is calming for both parent and baby.,5
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,"I never thought something would be able to provide the type of relief that a bath does for my daughter, but this product provides the same stimulative relief that the hot water from the bath does.  Anyone who has a child with colic knows that the heat from a bath helps greatly to release that trapped air and they pass a tremendous amount of it and sometimes even have a bowel movement because the relief feels so great! It's nutz what heat stimulation therapy does for a baby's colicy tummy.  Buying this product has helped so much! 20 seconds in the microwave and boom, it's done! If we have another child with colic, we'll purchase this product again, 100% for sure! I would reccomend it to anyone! My daughter was only 4 lbs when she came home, and this fit her very well since it has a velcro closure that connects one side with the other. I really wish I would of known of this product for our first daughter... poor baby had to suffer for the 1st 3 months of her new tiny life. Anyone with a baby struggling with colic should definitly use this product for their little one... and the price is just right, however there just isn't a price you can place on pain relief for your newborn!!!",5
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,"I was amazed at how well this product works. For about a month my son would get really bad gas and just scream for hours. You could just feel his super tight little tummy and imagine his pain. The gas drops didn't really do much after his tummy got to that point so I tried this tummy band. It was amazing how quickly he would relax and drift off to sleep. Other reviews mention the band leaving burns on the baby's belly, I always put the band on over clothes and followed the heating instructions and not once had a burned baby belly. The only reason I did not give this product 5 stars is it is a little tricky to keep the band from riding up. I want it to just stay on the belly but it shifts easily and can be tricky to readjust. Otherwise I would recommend this product for babies suffering from gassy tummies. Plus it smells good too.",4
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,"This item doesn't calm my baby's colic. When she is crying, the tummy band makes here more upset. However, I am using it when she is calm to make her keep that way. It smells well, however, I don't think it is a must to have item. Gripe water is much better for tummy colic.",3
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,We have been using with my little baby but no results. Colics and pain still are here. Only medicines are making effects.,1
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,My son had colic and would scream for hours a day and stiffen up.  We used the happi tummi when these spells would start and it helped calm him enough to where he would fall asleep. I wish I would have had one of these for my other 2 kids..Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,5
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,"The heat pack didn't really do anything for our baby, and I laugh/cringe at this blurb from the item description:  ""... the herbs are activated to release healing properties which provide almost immediate relief of most common stomach ailments.""  Yeah, sure, whatever.However, it makes an adequate emergency swaddle cloth when you can't find your regular blanket or swaddle cloth.  We wrap it around our daughter's body with her arms in front so that she can't startle herself awake with her arms.What finally brought relief to our baby's gassy/fussiness was changing her formula.  Our fifth formula in eight weeks, Similac Alimentum, did it and she's like a different baby.  Much happier, more mellow, alert and not so upset all the time.  Too bad we had to go through five other formulas to get there! (Enfamil Lipil with Iron, Enfamil LacoFree, Similac R.S. Sensitive, Similac Sensitive, and now Similac Alimentum).",3
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,"I was hopeful this product would work wonders and I'd have a happy baby in my arms in no time.  Well, it didn't.  It's easy to use - just microwave the little pouch and put it inside the belt, put the belt on the baby. Easy, right? Well, the belt is bulky and looks like it could be uncomfortable...and my baby just screamed louder when we got near her with it.  In fact, when we took it away we had better luck with her calming down.  I got rid of it since it didn't work.",1
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,I didn't see this work for my son. He had a lot of gas pains when he was first born and nothing really seemed to help him. I didn't really see any change in him when he wore it. In fact it often times made him pretty angry.It did have a funky smell but it wasn't terribly offensive. The minky material is soft and it was well made. I just wish that it would have worked.,1
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,"We tried this on our colicky granddaughter and it really seemed to calm her down and made her little tummyfeel so much better,Waistband is well made and could even be used with an ice pack for comfort.",5
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,"Got this when we were desperate for relief for our little ones. They had severe reflux, gassy bellies etc. The minky material is soft and the packet does smell pleasant although I think it wore off (if possible) in a few months. I don't recommend this but having been 'there'-desperate for anything to help your baby then I'd get it just in case it does work. Who knows- you might be one of those people who swear by it. For us it just sits in the back of a drawer.",2
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,Great product!! Seems to really work!! We tried this product just on a whim & this really seems to work w our daughters colic!!,5
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,"We bought 3 more!  Dont waste your money on something else just because it looks all cute with fancy print.  This band will be able to be used for months if not years.  sizing is adjustable and heat pack really nice option we used it at first and it really helped.  He now sleeps better and is not fussy we use the band daily,  I will be buying these as baby shower gifts from now on.. Life saver for us.",5
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,"I really wanted this belt to work, it looks so cute and feels comfy. The warm herbal pack is nice too but, it does nothing for my baby. I was hoping it would calm her down especially when she gets colicky or gassy but this little belt did absolutely nothing besides look cute.",2
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,"My husband and I are very pleased with the outcome of using Happi Tummi Colic and Gas Relief Waistband. It relieves our newborn stomach discomfort, calms her down and even helped her poop when we first started using it. I would recommend this product to everyone with a newborn - sooner or later you'll need something to calm your baby's upset tummy and this is one efficient way to do it.",5
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,"My son would cry every evening from about 4 to 9pm. The first time I used the Happi Tummi he imediatley relaxed and stopped! Honestly he looked 'high' he was so calm.. :) I would put it on him snug and cuddle him up against me to give that added pressure and comfort. Luckily he's much better now, but happi tummi was a life saver!!",5
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,"I BOUGHT this because my son Liam is so gassy and he cries all the time due to gas and stomach pain. It really helps because  makes my son baby Liam much more able to handle the pain. The only problem is that the fabric its to warm and thick and if is a hot day, he sweats so bad, but stills ok, because it helps him to sleep due a colic and gas pain....",5
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,"My 7 week son has had horrible gas and colic, lasting several hours and ruining the routine that was set because he was in so much pain. I have given him gas drops, gripe water, massaged his stomach, and did the ""bicycle"" with his legs. (Everything except for the ""bicycle"" worked his large intestine, but never solved the problem because the gas was building in the small intestine.) But this is a product you have to try it at least once for your infant! Do it for the baby's relief, and to restore lost sleep to both you and your baby! It worked around 10 seconds for my son, and was so fast, I was trying to figure out my baby's ""new expression""- not realizing he actually went straight from screaming his lungs out to falling asleep after putting it around his waist. You will not be disappointed!!",5
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,"I'm not sure if its the heat on her belly or the smell, but it calms my colicky baby down everytime! Worth every penny!",4
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,"My grandson (almost 3 months old) has been having a lot of tummy pain since birth and different drops and holding him in different positions have been tried with some to no luck.  This has helped him quite a bit, along with using gas, colic, or probitic drops.  I am not sure if anything helps completely, but this is at the top of the list.",4
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,"Didn't work on my daughter's colic. Smells nice, good concept, but just didn't do anything for us. Colief and Probiotics did. Now she is a happy girl. Wish this had worked as it was preferable. Will keep it for future tummy upsets.",2
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,"I love the Happi Tummi wrap, it worked wonders for our poor gassy little baby. I can only speak from our experience with it, I know that it may not work for every baby; but it was truly a lifesaver in our house. Our baby had terrible gas pains for several months. We tried using gripe water and gas drops and nothing seemed to help. Finally we tried the Happi Tummi and it worked far better than we would have ever thought! As soon as we would warm it up and put it on her tummy she would stop crying and calm down, it was amazing! The herbal pouch smells nice and has a very soothing aroma. The waistband is made from a nice soft material that is easily machine washable if it gets dirty. I would highly recommend this product to anyone that has a baby that suffers from terrible gas pain!",5
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,Love the smell of the insert for this waistband. It did help my child with a gassy tummy. Good purchase for gassy tummy.,4
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,Great for helping with tummy aches and other colic issues in babies and younger toddlers.  The heat moves everything and the herbs help the sinuses also. Highly recommended!,5
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,"This band does not stay in place- keeps moving around the tummy!! It is very irritating since i really wanted this to work.. cannot keep trying to move this in place for an already crying kid! The herbal pouch smells great when warmed up... but it is not warm enough to be effective. Also, it is a little too wide for 2 month old kids.",2
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,"Didn't do much for my son,  we had tried it on and off for a couple months for the most part it didnt seem to do anything",3
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,This product is a GOD-SEND!!!  Nothing worked better.  Worked like a CHARM.Try it.  Get your life back and make that baby happy!!!,5
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,My baby loves this and it soothes him :).  It also smells great!  I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to calm their baby--colicky or not.,5
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,My baby cried from 10am-10pm everyday.  We tried every wive's tale out there.  Here is the secret formula that helped us:1) Happi Tummi (only heat it for 20 sec)2) Hyland's Colic Tablets (very cheap and work WONDERS!)3) Mylicon drops4) Gripe Water5) Fisher-Price Baby Wellness ""No More Crying"" CD (odd--but it worked!)Bless your heart if you are dealing with colic right now.  It will be over soon and all will be MUCH better!,5
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,"It really works to calm down our colic-y baby.  This, combined with the five steps in ""The Happiest Baby on the Block"" have saved our sanity.",5
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,"I'm not too sure if this actually helped her gas and colic, however I am still using it as a general heating pad for my daughter.",3
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,My son was colicky and I could have bought anything to help me. I tried several things and this was one among them and It simply dint work.ended up returning it. I dont think there is anything that will work for colic it is just a phase which has to pass,1
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,"When our son was a newborn he had a really tough time with gas. We hated to see him in pain, so we tried everything. His doctor recommended putting warm wash cloths on his tummy while he lay on his back for a few minutes to let the bubbles come together and then burping him. We had some success with that, and when we saw this it looked like a similar treatment with a little less trouble.It works pretty well. It usually helped calm him down. As a veteran of the Tummy Wars I would suggest this or the warm wash clothes, combined with Baby's Bliss Gripe Water 4 oz. and Mylicon (it's safe to use both) and comfort from you.It does get better! Good luck!",4
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,"The Happi Tummi has really helped my granddaughter. She was having some gas, typical of lots of newborns, the soothing smell and warmth on her tummy helped her relax and fall asleep. I wish we had this when my kids were babies",5
Russ Berrie Pregnancy Calendar,"10 years ago I used this for my first daughter, I liked it enough that I bought it again 3 years later for my next daughter! Now here I am 10 years later and I only wanted this calendar because I loved it for my girls! I used it a year ago for my first son and now I am using it for another son to be born soon! I love looking back at all the things I wrote down and that they all have the same calendar! I would recommend this for a nice simple calendar especially for those busy moms!",5
Russ Berrie Pregnancy Calendar,"I reccomend this russ baby - pregnancy calendar to everyone, especially if your pregnant, it is great you will love it !",5
Russ Berrie Pregnancy Calendar,I am pregnant with my sixth child and I purchased this calendar to use as a daily written diary of my pregnancy. I also have the same calendar for four of my other children. It has been fun to review my notes of previous calendars to see how this pregnancy compares with the previous pregnancies. I have also enjoyed reading and sharing the stories (such as the first kick) with my children as they get older. The calendar also gives a brief week by week account of the baby development. I hope you enjoy this product as much as I have! P.S. It was  quite satisfying to write  about my  morning sickness when no one else could feel my pain.,5
Russ Berrie Pregnancy Calendar,"I got this calendar as a gift from my mom, then purchased as a gift for my friend. It is such a fun way to count down the days of pregnancy and has cute stickers to mark those special milestones while growing a tiny human!  I can't wait for my daughter to read the calendar where I logged her first moves when she is older!",5
Russ Berrie Pregnancy Calendar,"I loved this! I wasn't good about keeping it updated, but it's a great keepsake if you do.",5
Russ Berrie Pregnancy Calendar,"This calendar is absolutely great for recording everything that goes on in your pregnancy. You enter in the dates and any other information you want. It also came with stickers for important dates,events,and emotions. I used it for my first pregnancy and plan on getting another for my second pregnancy.",5
Russ Berrie Pregnancy Calendar,"The calendar was given to me as a gift. It's functional and serves its purpose but could use some improving. It seems a bit out dated for my taste, as if it was designed nearly 50 years ago. Because you have to fill in the dates, Sunday isn't always on the left where a traditional calendar would place it. The stickers are an adorable feature, but it's for those mom's to be who are looking for a more medical pregnancy labor and delivery. I liked that it would tell me the fetal development but when I purchase another pregnancy calendar I will not be getting this calendar.",4
Crocodile Creek Dinosaur Bib,These bibs are terrific!  They are functional and fabulous to look at no matter which design you choose!  The best thing is that they are waterproof and can quickly be cleaned after each feeding.  They dry relatively quickly and are ready for another use about five or six hours after getting them fully wet to clean.  I would buy two so that you could rotate them out after each feeding.  Great product!,5
Discovery Toys WORKING TRIO Dump Trucks,"My kids, ages 2 years and 5 years, both love these trucks. The fact that they stack up and also hook together, train-style, are huge pluses. Also, the clicking sound that the dumping part (sorry, I don't know the proper term) makes when you move it up and down is very satisfying and fun.The trucks are friction-powered, and this adds a lot of play value because kids can zoom them across the floor. I rarely, if ever, find toys of this quality and play-value in the store (no, I am not a Discovery Toys consultant, just a mom who appreciates good toys).",5
DaVinci Kalani 4 -Drawer Baby Dresser - Cherry,This is the biggest piece of crap furniture I have ever purchased. Don't waste your money. Spend a little extra and get something that will last. The drawers don't fit right and change positions every time you open them. I hate this dresser!!,1
DaVinci Kalani 4 -Drawer Baby Dresser - Cherry,"I ordered this dresser from Amazon and it arrived damaged. Huge chunks were taken out of the top of the dresser. It appears that wherever Amazon had this item shipped from did not properly store or transport it. Accidents happen, so I returned the item and exchanged it for a new one, again with Amazon. This time the dresser was WORSE. The top piece was completely SPLIT IN HALF! Again, I returned the item. I ordered the dresser from Babies R Us and it came beautifully packaged and did not have any damage. I was very disappointed in Amazon. To have this happen twice is unacceptable. I will not order from Amazon again because it is clear they deal with vendors that are not up to par.",1
DaVinci Kalani 4 -Drawer Baby Dresser - Cherry,"My parents bought this furniture set for my son thinking it would last.  It's not going to make it to his 2nd birthday.  We have to look into buy all new furniture for my baby's room now that he's 18 months. That's about how long this will last.  Draw fronts are falling off when you open the drawers.  The drawer bottoms slide out and his clothes get stuck or fall through and the drawer can't open.  These problems have come from just light clothes in the drawer and gentle use.  It also scratches easily and look like it's 20 years old, not a year and a half.  Save yourself some money and spend the extra money initially to buy something made of real wood and that is built for you.Hope that helps some future parents from being annoyed with wasting money on this furniture.",1
DaVinci Kalani 4 -Drawer Baby Dresser - Cherry,"We just finished assembling this piece of furniture. It's right along what I expected to get. The instruction manual could use some more detail, but studying the diagrams we were able to figure it out. Two of the bolts for attaching the bottom base to the rest of the dresser were poorly designed. We left them off because you would have had to take the bottom drawer track off to get the bolt to screw in. I don't think it is going to matter structurally though, because there are four other bolts holding it together.A few of the drawers were a little wobbly until the drawer bottom was secured in place. I thought that was one area that could be improved, the drawer construction.Overall, still a solid piece of furniture. It will probably last as long as the crib/bed does, and that's what we were looking for in our purchase.",4
DaVinci Kalani 4 -Drawer Baby Dresser - Cherry,"I read the reviews and was somewhat concerned but purchased it regardless.  I am very happy with my choice so far.  It took a bit to put together but was not hard at all and the instructions were pretty good with lots of pictures.  My only problem with the instructions was with the sides, they were vague and the sides were not clearly marked.  In the end I was carefully looking at the tiny predrilled holes (slight indents more like it) and laying the drawer tracks on it until I was sure which was which.Yes the sides are chipboard with cherry laminate so you have to take special care when attaching the hardware not to strip out the holes.  Just remember that in the instructions it clearly says to not use power tools!  So if you do and it strips it is really your fault not the companies quality.  Saying that I did use a Dewalt 12v drill driver to put in most of the screws, but it is designed to &#34;slip or pulse&#34; as the screws start to hit resistance and is specifically made to just put in screws.The top, frames and drawer fronts are hardwood, and the drawer sides and back are cabinet grade plywood.  I used some wood glue on the dowels that hold the feet (in addition to the provided screws) and glued the drawer fronts with the sides (had dowels too) and also the back to the sides.  No glue on the drawer bottom though.  Just a habit I have anytime I'm working with wood products.I took my time and do think this will be a sturdy dresser.",4
DaVinci Kalani 4 -Drawer Baby Dresser - Cherry,We love this dresser for the nursery!  WARNING its a pain to assemble.  It literally took my husband (handy) 5 hours to put this thing together.  The end product is amazing but it was not an easy task. :),4
DaVinci Kalani 4 -Drawer Baby Dresser - Cherry,"While I like the look of this dresser, it is not worth the price.  We followed the instructions for assembly exactly, and all seemed well for about 2 months.  After a couple of months of light use, the front of one of the drawers fell off (we weren't sliding the drawers out hard).  It turns out the screw holding the drawer on wasn't keeping the drawer front in place.  We used wood glue to put the drawer back together.About a month later, the same thing happened on another drawer.  Again, we used wood glue to fix the problem.  In total, this has happened 5 times since we started using the dresser 10 months ago.  For the price, I would have expected the quality to be much better.We've been very careful when opening the drawers due to the problems we've had, but the fronts continue to fall off.  When my son gets older and starts dressing himself, we'll probably have to buy a new dresser, as this one won't hold up.  I wish I would have saved my money on this and bought a higher-quality dresser that would last.  In the future, I will not buy this brand of furniture again.",1
DaVinci Kalani 4 -Drawer Baby Dresser - Cherry,This looked so nice in the picture but ended up being horrible. There were scratches all over it. There were MANY pieces to put together. The fake wood kept cracking when my husband tried to put it together. We gave up and decided to send it back.,1
DaVinci Kalani 4 -Drawer Baby Dresser - Cherry,"Ignore the crazy people with a poor review on this because of the quality of this dresser. Of course it's not the nicest, most fancy well built dresser ever made, but for the money it is a very nice dresser. It is exactly what I expected. The finish is very nice, but be careful with it because it can scratch easy. Yes the wood is particle board and pine but what would you expect for the price. The drawers open & close with ease and it all went together fairly easily. Great bang for your buck.",3
DaVinci Kalani 4 -Drawer Baby Dresser - Cherry,"We have the DaVinci Kalani crib and changing table and both are great and so we decided to get the dresser, it was very difficult to put together and the drawers did not line up properly and were too small for the sliding mechanics on the side to fit in.  I wish I could have returned it but it was already half put together by the time we realized it was crap and we couldn't take it back apart without completely ripping it up...",1
DaVinci Kalani 4 -Drawer Baby Dresser - Cherry,This dresser is worth the money. It is heavy but built better than your average dresser from local department stores. I highly recommend this product. Easy to put  together. Direction are like any other very difficult to understand.,5
DaVinci Kalani 4 -Drawer Baby Dresser - Cherry,Have the same dresser in my two year old's room. Bought another for my second child's room. Works great and is beautiful.,5
DaVinci Kalani 4 -Drawer Baby Dresser - Cherry,"I have read a lot of reviews stating how poorly constructed the dresser was made, but I decided to purchase it anyways, just to see. I could not disagree more with the bad quality reviews. This dresser is perfect! The color is exact, the drawers glide in and out smoothly, and it did not scratch easily. The only thing that I was not happy about, was the fact that the building directions are extremely vague, and it took forever to build this thing. The only thing cheap about this dresser, is the bottom of the dresser drawers, which seem to be made of cheap ply wood. But, they seem to hold up good. Considering that in the past, I have only boughten furniture from walmart, which is made purely of press board, and cracks if screws are to tight, chips off if its banged into, and typically always breaks down within a year of use, this product is great. Its extremely sturdy, does not wobble or anything, and is very hard to tip over ( so im sure my child wont be able to do it)",5
DaVinci Kalani 4 -Drawer Baby Dresser - Cherry,"Fine craftsmanship but quite a bit overpriced.PROS:Excellent fit and finish. The screw holes were pre-marked/ predrilled with precision and had no issues with part placement.Paint is evenly applied and generously coated and will not scratch off easily.

I saw similar items that cost less.Parts were not marked with letters or numbers for ease of installation.

DaVinci Kalani Combo Dresser - Cherry,The mounting parts was complete. The dresser color was in good shape. The reason I wasn't completely satisfied with this product was that there was some damages (Scrach or paint removals) on the changing table surface. This board requires to be fixed or changed. I haven't contacted the seller but I would like to get contacted by them to resolve this issue ASAP.,3
DaVinci Kalani Combo Dresser - Cherry,I really love the look of this dresser and how quickly I recieved it. Putting it together took me 4 hours single handed so with more help may take less time. Directions were a little tricky as far as which piece is which but it wasn't that hard to figure out. My biggest complaint is the drawers after assembly they go in fine but get stuck a little at the end I have to push a little harder to get them to shut all the way. The bottom of the drawers are also thin pieces of wood that don't quite fit the drawer so it slides up and down but again not that big of a deal. Another concern is the inside of the cabinet the two shelves just sit inside which is not sturdy. It would be alot better if there were more pegs to keep the top shelf steady. The bottom one is litteraly just placed and slides back and forth and can come out with ease which is not a good thing for the little ones. The look overall is very nice and I didn't have any problems with scratches I even dropped a piece an it didn't scratch. Mostly just minor things to keep in mind but maybe not something you would want to deal with for the amount of money you would be spending on this product.,3
DaVinci Kalani Combo Dresser - Cherry,This dresser is great and looks very nice in the babies' room.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it took 5 hours to put together (have 2 screwdrivers and it may not take you as long :) ) It is very sturdy and will work great as a changing table also.,4
DaVinci Kalani Combo Dresser - Cherry,The dresser was nice but the assembly instructions were very difficult and pieces were not labeled or coded.  The was a scratch on the door and one piece (an internal frame was broken.,3
DaVinci Kalani Combo Dresser - Cherry,My mother bought this for my son together with a crib. We found the product genuine with solid wood and has lots of space for storage.,5
DaVinci Kalani Combo Dresser - Cherry,"The item is not sturdy.  This is an expensive baby piece of furniture. It scratches MUCH TOO EASILY!In placing the book case unit over the dresser- it made a dent- and that was with VERY LITTLE movement or pressure.  Then the Wood cracked where the screws were inserted- again with very little pressure.  The pieces are good to look at- and look attractive.  However, the pricing is quite high and not worth the workmanship quality.",3
DaVinci Kalani Combo Dresser - Cherry,VERY frustrating assembly. The pictures in the thin instructions don't resemble the parts.... and there's many parts. I'd rather throw it in the trash and be done with it at this point.,1
DaVinci Kalani Combo Dresser - Cherry,"The order came with no damage, relatively easy to put together and looks beautiful.  We have been told that the wood is soft s be careful not to scratch when putting together.  We have not used it yet but seems like it will be jsut fine",4
DaVinci Kalani Combo Dresser - Cherry,"I purchased this to go with my Davinci Emily 4-in-1 crib.  My husband and father worked together to put this piece of furniture together.  They said that it was a pain, but that all it really took was a lot of patience and a little bit of extra time.  I didn't experience any problems with the varnish smelling badly.  As others have mentioned, if you don't want a piece that shows wear, you might want to look at something else.  This is made of very soft wood (pine), so dents show easily.  However, the oak color does a nice job of making the wear and tear less obvious than on darker models.  The price on Amazon was great--the best I found!  Shipping was good and the product arrived undamaged.  The one thing to think about before you purchase is the set up of your nursery and where you plan to put this.  While it's a great space saver, if you don't have a space where it will work to have the changing table piece on the left, this might not be for you.  Ours ended up in a corner in a slightly less than ideal position because I didn't think about this before hand.The bottom line is, I would definitely buy this piece again.  It looks so great and is an awesome way to save a little bit of space!",5
DaVinci Kalani Combo Dresser - Cherry,"I was very surprised when I received this item.  Even though assembly is required, it is not a fake particle board piece of furniture.  A majority of the pieces are made of real wood.  The particle board parts are the bottom of the drawers and the back of the dresser/changer.  I also have the DaVinci Kalani crib and they match perfectly.  The drawers are a decent size and I really like how sturdy this piece is.  As for the shelf, it has only one setting.  I wish they had holes at different levels so that you could adjust the shelf to your comfort.  Still, not a big deal.  My baby is due in a couple of months so I haven't had a chance to use it yet, but I am confident that this is a sturdy piece of furniture that will hold up for a long time.",5
DaVinci Kalani Combo Dresser - Cherry,"We ordered this product along with a matching crib (DaVinci Kalani Convertible Baby Crib - Cherry).  These appeared to be a nice middle-ground between the really cheap particle-board and cardboard dressers at $200 and the (beautiful) Amish solid wood pieces at $1400+.  The crib is wonderful, and aside from scratching easily it is fantastic.This dresser, however, is another story.  In addition to the solid wood frame, the drawers have particleboard frame, and the drawer bottoms are the thinnest, cheapest cardboard you can find.  All of the hardware in the dresser is of poor quality, which caused numerous problems during assembly.  In one case, the screws pulverized the particleboard and I needed to purchase a new screw, drill my own hole, and hope that I didn't destroy the wood in doing so.As other reviewers have mentioned, the drawers also come apart fairly often (once/month).  I have been tempted to glue the drawers to decrease this frequency.  My concern with that is that the cardboard is so cheap, that I'm not sure it would hold up to the gluing, and I think that might be the end of the drawers.The entire unit sways a little bit too.  Tightening it only makes it worse (yikes!).Overall a big disappointment.  It looks beautiful, but it won't hold up.  We should have either spent less, or more on something that will really last.",2
DaVinci Kalani Combo Dresser - Cherry,"Shipped quick. Item is very heavy. Came in 2 boxes. Time intensive to put together. looks nice, but have patience. Be careful, nicks easily.",4
DaVinci Kalani Combo Dresser - Cherry,"My husband and I ordered this dress on 1 Jan 11 and received the dresser on 5 Jan 11. They shipped the dresser on the 3rd and got here two days later. How awesome is that?! I was really excepting to get the dresser the following week since it did say order will be received on 10 Jan 11.  We started to put the dresser together, but we stop and didn't finish it `til this past weekend.  The dresser looks great, and we both love the dresser (got it in white).  However, the pieces could have been labeled.  If the pieces were labeled it would have been a lot easier in assembling the dresser, but we got it. We were able to just look at the picture (besides the little side note instructions) and figure it out from there.  We hope our soon to be baby girl loves this dresser as she gets a little older. ( 3 weeks `til my due date)Side Note: This dresser can also be used as a TV Stand.Overall: Dresser is great, and I would recommend this dresser.",5

DaVinci Kalani 3 Drawer Changer in Cherry,"This changing table looks good, however it is poor quality and does not last. We have had it for 2 and 1/2 years and was hoping it would last till our second child is no longer in diapers. However, we have been having problems with the drawers for months. They are not fitting properly on the glider. It is now a struggle to open 2 out of the drawers, which is not what you want to deal with when you have a squirmy baby. I would recommend not getting one with the drawers (although it looks good) if you are hoping to keep it for more than 2 years.",2
DaVinci Kalani 3 Drawer Changer in Cherry,"I would recommend this changing dresser. I liked the expresso color and once it was put together, its a very sturdy changing table and will look nice in any nursery.",4
DaVinci Kalani 3 Drawer Changer in Cherry,When you open the drawers it feels cheaply made!  I felt like I would break it everytime I opened the drawer.,2
DaVinci Kalani 3 Drawer Changer in Cherry,"We bought this expecting something that we can get a year or two out of - given the construction I think we might be able to do it.  Overall, this matches the Kalani crib perfectly - but I am a little disappointed with the construction of the drawers, and expect to have problems at some point.  The table itself is very sturdy, and heavy - but the drawers seem to be made of a very light wood, and have flimsy bottoms along with cheap metal sliders.  We used gorilla glue on the dowels for some added strength.  This item is a little expensive for what it is - but still not that bad.  I love amazon reviews where people expect the world for 300 bucks - if you want something nicer, it will cost you double of this unit - and I don't know about you, but after the kids are out of diapers I don't really think I am going to have a need for a changing table and this unit will end up being recycled.  Same goes for the crib.  I would not hesistate buying this, unless of course you need your changing table to last 5+years.",4
DaVinci Kalani 3 Drawer Changer in Cherry,This table came with so many parts and it  wd have helped if d parts were labeled for easy identification. Assembly took over 2 hrs and the back cover is made of heavy and poor bread board which fell apart during assembly. My husband had to cut a better and lighter board at home depot to cover the back. I really have doubts bout how long this item will last us.,1
DaVinci Kalani 3 Drawer Changer in Cherry,"The color is beautiful, dark black.  Easy to put together, but the bottom drawer is warped and does not fully push in.",3
DaVinci Kalani 3 Drawer Changer in Cherry,"My husband and I love the look of the dresser, the color is great and true to its description.  It did take a while to put together, it really REALLY was a two person job. Between putting together the crib and dresser, it must've taken us 2 to 3 hours. However, now that it's all put together,  we are happy with how it looks.My one complaint is that there is already a nick on the front of the drawer, it's so deep that you can see the base wood and it really stands out. If the dresser was a couple of years old, it wouldn't be such a big deal but we haven't even used it yet and already there's an obvious flaw. Had I purchased it from a store already assembled, I would have exchanged it but having spent so much time putting it together, I'm just going to live with it.Overall, a great looking dresser, the color is great and although it has only 3 drawers, the drawers are a good size.",3
DaVinci Kalani 3 Drawer Changer in Cherry,"After a fiasco with an IKEA dresser that didn't have the holes lined up where they were supposed to be, we ordered the DaVinci Kalani.  It is beautiful, relatively easy to assemble, and feels solid.  It is also a great space and money saver -- originally we were going to cram both a changing table and a dresser into the nursery, but this takes the place of both :)",4
DaVinci Kalani 3 Drawer Changer in Cherry,"The reason i bought this changer was because it was a match with the crib, but once i got it home and started getting the pieces together it is bigger than i thought and i love it...",5
DaVinci Kalani 3 Drawer Changer in Cherry,We bought this product so much cheaper online rather than at the store. It has a lot of space and it was nice to put small baby to change his diapers.,5
DaVinci Kalani 3 Drawer Changer in Cherry,"It seems Davinci follows the IKEA model: make a product that initially looks great and is very functional, but which will disintegrate in 3-5 years. The Davinci changing table struck me as a work of design genius in its ability to deliver on looks and function, without a hint of over-engineering anywhere in the design.First the wood. As I was putting the table together I was amazed by the low density of the ""sustainable New Zealand pinewood"". Think balsawood, like model airplanes, not furniture. Simply pressing your fingernail into it leaves a mark.The finish looks great, but has an interesting synergy with the wood. Sliding the wood across the floor or white wall leaves unsightly black marks. However, the wood doesn't look damaged at all afterwards. It's as if the finish has sunk in very deep into the wood, maybe even into the core. The finish outgasses for a few weeks after you take the wood out of the box, but I trust that it's not toxic as I foresee my toddler consuming quite a bit of it.While the external wood is nicely finished, the drawers look and feel like P.O.S.s The wood on the inside of the drawers is unfinished and looks like it might leave splinters if rubbed too hard. The other P.O.S. design point is the changing board, which is ~1/4in particle board. You'll definitely not want your older child jumping on it.The whole table is held together by screws and bolts. I'm surprised that no lock washers were included, since this will make retightening a more frequent necessity.Overall the table appears that it will do the trick, do it once, and then retire to a landfill. If your budget is tight you will not regret buying this, but realize you won't be using it for other functions after the kid is 3 y.o. If you plan to have more than one kid, or would like a table with any resale value, buy something else.",3
DaVinci Kalani 3 Drawer Changer in Cherry,I bought this when my son was a newborn he is now 2 1/2.  This isn't the best quality set of drawers & also have a think about whether or not you want a changing table built in to your furniture because once your child is potty trained (about 2-3 years old) you wont need the changing table anymore!  I would recommend getting slightly better quality set of drawers without a  built in changing area - just put a change mat on top of your drawers that way they can keep the drawers for many years to come.,3
DaVinci Kalani 3 Drawer Changer in Cherry,"Extremely easy to set up, solid and sturdy. My wife and me are so happy with the product presentation for the price we paid. The only neg thing I can comment is that the cherry color is a little bit different than standard (Darker).",4
DaVinci Kalani 3 Drawer Changer in Cherry,Looks and fells basically like the photos. Very sturdy. I would only change 1. The drawers seem pretty delicate. The 'wood' is thin on the drawer bottom and I worry they won't last many years. And 2. I wish the product came with white plugs to cover the silver screw holes all over the sides. It's priced right (compared to less and more expensive changing tables.),4

"Munchkin Twisty Teether Ball, Colors May Vary","This has been a favorite teether for all of my 3 babies, especially when their teeth seem to be bothering them! When I first opened this toy, I thought that the little nubs seemed a little rigid; I expected them to be squishier -- but my kids haven't minded and seem to love it when they have teeth coming through.The clicking noise the ball makes when twisted seems really fascinating for an infant. When shaken, the ball makes a gentle rattling sound.  It's one of those very quiet toys appropriate for quiet occasions that some of the louder toys don't work for.I think the biggest thing this toy has to offer is the ease at which a baby can grasp this toy and chew on it. With all the little nubs, baby is always able to get one of them into her mouth.  The flatter, ring teethers are more difficult to manipulate with little hands -- seems like with those ones I have to help baby get it into her mouth.I haven't noticed any smell at all that previous reviewers talk about.  But, like another previous reviewer mentioned, I don't submerge this toy to wash it because i'm afraid that water will get trapped in the center.I wish that there was a loop somewhere to attach this to plastic links for when we're out and about in the stroller.  However, it seems pretty easy for baby to hold on to.",4
"Munchkin Twisty Teether Ball, Colors May Vary","My nine-month-old is not interested in this toy. I think it is because it smells like plastic. It must taste like plastic to him too.

I'm disappointed because I thought he would like the shape and be able to reach his back gums with it. Also, it CANNOT be immersed in water to clean. You'll get water inside if you do. Think: Mold. Yech! What kind of a teething toy is it when you can't get it completely clean!!?? The only positive things I have to say about it are: It is a good size. The rattle is a mild sound and the twisty noise is nice. I liked the colors too. But I would not recommend buying it. This toy is a design flop.",2

Infantino 20 Word Picture Puzzle,My kid really likes Infantino puzzles. They have big enough pieces that she can figure it out easily. This one is a little different in that it is several mini puzzles in one box. Each puzzle has 3-4 pieces. My daughter didn't complete every puzzle in the box before she wanted to go back and do the ""when I grow up"" Infantino puzzle. She likes that one a lot better.,4
Infantino 20 Word Picture Puzzle,My kid loves this.  It has a sturdy box with handle that keeps the pieces of puzzles together in 1 box... great for travelling too.i highly recommend this to kids 9 months and above.,4
Infantino 20 Word Picture Puzzle,"My 2.5 year old really likes this puzzle.  Based on someone's suggestion, I divided the puzzle up into 4 groups (in plastic baggies) because it was too overwhelming to find the pieces among all 20 words.  Right now she focuses on the picture, and I point out the letters and the completed word.  The letters are lower case, which is sort of new and a challenge.  This puzzle will have a long life span because it is sturdy and can operate on so many levels!  One criticism is that the t's and l's are written with curved bottoms so sometimes she thinks they are j's.  And there isn't a word with j in it to show her to compare.  But a really great puzzle!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,He likes chewing on all the parts especially the head and the ears! It has helped when he has been cranky because of teething. Great purchase!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My son loves this toy and fits great in the diaper bag. Also very easy to clean, just run right under the water. Seems to help him when he is getting a tooth.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"There really should be a large warning on the box.  Sheesh, in 2011 with so many anaphylactic latex allergies and Latex being an allergy that is caused by repeated exposure why in the world would someone think an all latex teether was a good idea for a baby??  This baby teether could have quite easily killed mommy and there was no warning on the packaging that is made of latex.",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"All the moms in my moms' group got Sophie for their babies so I wondered if there was something to the hype and got one too. My daughter LOVES Sophie. Kids really do love this thing. If we, heaven forbid, ever lost Sophie I'd have to run out and buy another one!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I was a little skeptical on whether Sophie was going to be worth the money, but after it arrived today I am very happy that I bought her.  My is almost 6 months old and is getting his two bottom teeth and he has not put her down all day.  He even carried her in his hands for 20 minutes while I shopped with him in the Bjorn.  Everything about this toy is wonderful.  Even the Squeak is not like some of those annoying squeaker toys out there.  If you are thinking about rather or not to buy Sophie take it from me and buy her you will not be disappointed!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I have been reading about Sophie and was going back and forth about whether to buy it for my little boy.  He is seven months old and everything goes in his mouth.  One of our friends gave him one last night for an early Christmas present and our baby is already in love with Sophie.  He cannot get enough of chewing on her.  The squeak is making our dog (a Rhodesian Ridgeback) a little jealous, so we're limiting playing with Sophie to only in the Pack and Play.  Sophie was easy for baby to grab and perfect for our late teether.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My neice loves her sophie and has spent hours drooling, chewing, throwing, squeezing and hitting her. Additionally they love to squeak and squeal back and forth at each other in delight.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"What a friendly face!  And those mesmerizing spots!  She's soft, easy to grab and chew on, and the squeak is sweet.  Be careful when you wash her though, cover up her ""squeak hole"" so you don't get water inside.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,We got this just for my son to chew on instead of anything he could cram in his mouth. He loved the feel of it I guess. It's rubber but  a strange type of rubber unlike anything I had seen before. I even took a chew on it once just to see what the fuss was about. It was slightly harder than I though it would be but clearly soothing to his little sore gums.It washed up easily but never really seemed to get &#34;dirty&#34; although it likely never even seen any dirt. Today it looks as new as we got it although some of the paint has worn off which is fine because its non toxic.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My baby seems to like this toy, but I could see how it would be a problem if he got it jammed in his mouth. This has not hapened yet, but I could see how it easily could. Also the paint and some of the rubber seems to have already come off and my baby does not even have teeth yet",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This product is without a doubt the best on the market. I have bought so many teethers and this is the only one my son likes. He mainly chews on her legs, but loves to just hold her as well. She works for teething and simply a toy. I would recommend this product to any and everyone, infact I am going to buy a few more and give them as shower gifts. The inexpensive price is a plus :) Just beware if you have a dog, she squeaks so puppies think she belongs to them :)!!!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I hear my wife talking about &#34;Sophie the Giraffe&#34; and that she wanted one for our daughter. I looked it up on Amazon and was astounded that it was $20.00, but when I gave it to my daughter who proceeded to munch on Sophie's head and feet the price was no big deal. She loves it and my wife loves it bc it is all natural. Great product. You wont regret buying it for your little one.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I splurged and got this for my teething baby.  At first, he couldn't quite get any piece in his mouth.  He was only about 3 months and a tiny guy.  Now, at 9 months, this goes everywhere with us!  The squeaker took a little getting used to, but it's fine.  An older lady at a restaurant said 'Ugh, look at that poor baby, they are making him play with a dog toy!&#34;  Pssshh, who cares he loves it, and loves to make it squeak!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"He liked it, but he didn't go crazy for it as I thought he would. He liked this teether, just like any of the other 10+ I bought him. He liked chewing on it, but he didn't preferred over any other. I liked it more than he did, but the quality and the material is very soft and safe for a baby.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My 5 month-old baby loves his Sophie. One of his best hobbies is chew the giraffe ears. And neck. And legs...,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My nine month old has had Sophie since she was three months old. Not only has Sophie been a great teether since she is chewy, easy to grab, and has a lot of ends to chew on, my daughter has also found her to be a great comfort when she is in pain from teething or just upset. We squeak Sophie a few times and she never fails to deliver a smile! We never leave the house without her! We've noticed that slowly Sophie's food grade safe coloring is fading or coming off but she is made with 100% safe chemicals so we're not worried. I will be purchasing her as gifts for new moms and my own children in the future!-Adrienne",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,my son is now 5 and half months old n i bought him this teether when he was 4 months old ... he didn't like it at first but these days Sophie is his favourite toy... he just like to chew Sophie's legs all the time... It is really very soft for baby's gums... i wil highly recommend this teether...a little bit expensive but its worth it...,4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"First, I should qualify this by stating that my children have never been contented by the normal baby soothers--swings, jumpers, bouncy seats.  So it does not entirely surprise me that this was not the miracle device my friends had promised.  She does enjoy chewing on his feet, but only marginally more than any other teether. I do like Sophie because she is so cute and nostalgic looking.  But I don't think she is necessarily worth the $16 I paid.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I thought Sophie was an expensive for a baby toy -- but after reading the reviews, I decided to buy her. So glad I did! My 6 month old loves her! Seems to help a lot with his teething.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"The giraffe never left my grandaughter's hands or sight (5 1/2 mos old) once she received this for Christmas.It is eye catching, soft, durable, hopefully, and so soothing to her gums. The squeaker is tolerable as well!I recommend it for a teething, semi soft toy!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My son loves this giraffe, it's perfect for teething and is entertaining with the squeaky sound that it makes. The ears and horns and hooves are great for a baby to stick in his mouth.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My child loved this when he was teething and now he just plays with it as a regular toy. Very cute yet the squeaker does get annoying :) it's perfect for a teething baby!!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My 3 month old was just starting to show interest in grabbing things, so I bought this in advance. She grabbed it and put it to her mouth at first glance!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"The Vulli Sophie giraffe teether is the greatest little toy for an infant!  It is easy to hang on to, the child can chew on the head, legs, neck, etc.It has been loved by all who have received it from me.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Just as described. Wonderful product. Babies love this! They can bite any area on Sofie and find her stimulating and occupy their time nicely. Item came quickly and efficiently. No issues with seller.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I can't see how this product can be safe for children. Color coating on mine has been peeling off from the first day I got it. I've shopped from Amazon for many years and usually love the products I purchase; but, this is not just about me not liking it, this is a much bigger problem. It is about the safety of my baby!!!!! I'll not recommend this product to anybody!!!! Please do not buy it......",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,we got a lot of use out of it. This was a life saver on our international flight when our daughter was teething. Color has faded over time(have been using for over 4 months now) and it does not really look like new anymore.,4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I'll be honest...I bought this toy because all the hip parents seem to have one too and I wanted to be a part of the ""hip parent"" crowd. The price-tag was somewhat of a deterent but I prevailed and purchased this teether for my daughter.At first, Lily didn't know what to make of of Sophie and showed little interest in the polka-dotted creature. I continued to introduce Lily to Sophie and kept the toy in the carrier so that it was on-hand during transitions. Eventually, Lily discovered what a wonderful experience it was to gnaw on the hooves and ears and these two have never been far apart since.Lily really enjoys gumming all the different parts of Sophie like no other teether we have. The size of the toy is great as it is somewhat substantial and so easy for a little one to grasp and hold onto. Lily really enjoys hearing Sophie squeak and will smile whenever Sophie makes a noise or pops her head up from Mommy's lap to say hello.People have stopped and commented on Sophie and to them I have stated, ""It's worth every penny."" I can't imagine not having this toy, it has become part and parcel with Lily's daily existence. She is soothed by it, loves to chew on it and seems endlessly entertained by it.Someday, Sophie will have earned her retirement. She will relocate to Lily's keepsake box. But until then, this little French Giraffe will embark on many adventures alongside my daughter as they explore this big world around them.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I don't have any complaints it seems like a well made toy. abit on the price side but My daughter didn't take to it at all.,4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Both my 4 month old and my dog love Sophie the Giraffe. She squeaks like a dog toy which makes things a little confusing for my pup. But my baby is teething now and loves to gnaw on Sophie - her face, her legs - any part he can get in his mouth. I'm not sure what it is about this toy but he loves it so I can't complain!Update: 11/2013Well, Sophie is cute, and absolutely everyone has one. But... in hindsight, I think it was a waste of money. My son gnawed on her for maybe 2 weeks and then moved on. For the price, I could've bought 5 different teething toys instead of just this one.I think at this point Sophie has become a must-have toy because it's so pervasive in the new mommy culture, but really... I'm just not impressed. Several other moms I know have said the same. It's cute and makes a great gift... but it's really not used much for what its intended.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Product is made of good material, it's as described, i just find it a bit more expensive for this particular model",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My son hated all teething toys. As soon as I handed Vulli Sophie over to him he was able to get his small hands around the giraffe and use it as a teether and toy. Definitely a good buy.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Bought this early.  I bought it because I feel it will be easy to hold and to add a Pacifier strap when shopping.  I feel it will do great.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I had just finally received this yesterday and I must say that it was totally worth it! My son has been teething for a while and I have been wanting to get this for him since he was born! I finally made the decision and went with it. I am sooooo glad I did, because the smile on his face was worth every penny. He's been gnawing on it non-stop. When it squeaks, he looks at it and smiles, so I guess he likes it. The only thing I am not so keen on was the strong rubber smell at first, but after washing it a few times, the smell wears off. Other than than, Sophie is cute as a button and I'm glad I got her!",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Sophie was a very unique teething toy.  My son loved to chew on her legs and hear her squeak - even our dog was pretty enthralled with her squeak (hehe).  Unfortunately, we brought her out in the town and he dropper her from his stroller and we lost her forever - I need to buy a new one!!",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This squeaky toy is great for teething babies. it's durable, flexible and just plain fun. The paint has come off a bit after continued use, but that's to be expected.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My 5 month old baby daughter loves her Sophie!!! It's easy for her to hold and put in her mouth. She is starting to get two teeth and this is definitely her preferred teether.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I was intrigued with the idea of Sophie the Giraffe, her story and the fact that she carries a nearly $20 price tag, so wanting to know what the hype was all about, I purchased her for my 21/2 month old baby boy. As of right now, he has no interest in her. He doesn't find her interesting to look at and is not teething so her main purpose of use hasn't been tested yet. I do not believe I will be able to test her out with my son either as the paint is already peeling off Sophie's head were her horns are. My other complaint is that dirt/dust clings to her. To me, she is nothing but a glorified puppy chew toy (the size of my hand). But at least I know what the hype is all about and now, Sophie and now an on going joke between my girl-friends and I (the $20 puppy chew toy I bought for my baby.)",2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,This is a must have for any baby.  We have tons of different typs of ""teethers"" in our house but my son loves Sophie!  Not only does he love to chew on her but the sqeaking sound helps to calm him down.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,It's a squeaky toy. I bought it because my baby really liked the Little People giraffe. I thought this giraffe might be extra special or something. It is an overpriced (way overpriced) squeaky toy. My baby still prefers her other giraffe and throws this one aside. I'm dumb. I paid $17 for a squeaky toy.,1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This teether is made of a soft all-natural rubber. It has legs that can be chewed on, a nice long neck, as well as head and ears that are great for teething babies too. It does squeak when squeezed or bitten, which initially scared my son, but when he is in the right mood he loves it! It is lightweight so babies can actually hold it on their own, unlike so many teethers we have. My 5 month-old is having a blast with his new Sophie Giraffe!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My son loves to chew on his Sophie. He is just starting to teeth  and he uses this as one of his favorite chews. He also is now starting to reconize sophie squeak. When I squeak it he will turn his head and look for it.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I got Sophie for my almost 5 month old daughter today. She wouldn't put Sophie down! She chewed on Sophie's ears, horns and, especially, hooves. Sophie is the best teether we've ever had! I wish I had gotten Sophie for my first son 5 years ago. Yes, she is pricey, but Sophie is worth every penny when you see the comfort she gives your teething baby. I'm considering buying a second Sophie to keep in the diaper bag.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I didn't buy this in amazon, but it had to write a review. My baby loves Sophie the Giraffe. Now he can grab toys with his hands and I need to bring Sophie everywhere we go. Expensive but worth it!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Nice toy and cute  but my dog wants it more than my son....for spending that much money I was disappointed.,3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This was one of the first toys that I bought my daughter .  She loved it!  From the beginning it was one of her favorites.  She loved chewing on it when she was teething, and spent many happy moments experimenting with different ways to make it squeak - stepping on it, shaking it, biting it, squeazing it, etc....  It's surprisingly resiliant, and it's so cute!  Not to mention that it's natural rubber and non-toxic so I felt comfortable with her putting it in her mouth.  Now she's almost 2 and she still loves her Sophie.  It's definitely a keeper in case I have any more children - hopefully my daughter will be able to share!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"With only a few days worth of minimal play, I noticed that the spots on the toy were starting to disappear.  I licked my fingertip and gently wiped at the paint.  Sure enough, it came right off!  I don't care if the paint is ""natural,"" I still don't want my baby to ingest it.I tried to write to the company that manufactures the product about this defect, and I never even heard back from them.  They apparently don't care about customer service or the quality of their products.This is a horrible toy- especially considering how expensive it is.",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"It feels flimsy and reminds me of a cheap dogs squeak toy by my daughter LOVES it. It's been almost a year and some of the orange has faded, but other than it's still in great condition and gets a lot of attention.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This is a wonderfully designed product, and has already gotten a lot of use! Because it is made out of natural rubber, there are no worries about harmful plastics. The vendor provides quick, safe shipping. A great purchase.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"It's a big price tag for a teether. My husband still teases me that I could have gotten 10 toys just like it for the same price at petsmart.  But, the materials are all safe and natural and something about the design makes it irresistible for babies to chew on.  It also squeaks, so if you have a dog that likes squeaker toys, skip this baby toy unless you want the dog to steal it. Teething isn't forever, your child may think this toy is the coolest thing since nipples on bottles, but by the age of two at the absolute latest, more likely before the age of one, your kid is going to ditch this toy.  Ask yourself if you want to pay more than $10 for a toy that is meant to be chewed on and isn't going to hold any interest for your child a year from now.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I bought Sophie for my baby because I saw the reviews on Amazon and thought it looked cute.  We do love it!  My 3 month old son loves to look at Sophie; there's something about her face that captivates him. He likes the spots, too, but I know he loves her eyes, rosy cheeks, and smile.  The toy is a soft rubber and does have a loud and slightly annoying squeak in my opinion, but it does get the baby's attention.  I don't mean this to be negative, but for comparison's sake, it is similar to a dog toy. I appreciate the safety standards that reassure me it is safe to be a baby teether.  One thing I would caution is to look at the measurements; I did not and was surprised that the toy is kind of small--the picture is a little deceiving.  But it's actually a great size, fits in the diaper bag easily and also a good size for your little one to hold.  Sophie reminds me of a baby toy I had in the 70's (a rubber elephant that my mom says I loved), so I think the idea of this toy is a classic...which is a classic for a reason!",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,It isn't quite as big as I had hoped/expected. I also didn't realize that it squeaked. I do think it's a bit over priced & even my dog thinks its a dog toy. :/,4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My son adores his Sophie. He is constantly chewing on her. We keep her in our diaper bag and she goes everywhere with us. She was a perfect toy for our son to hold before he was able to grip very well because she is very light. A word of caution: She does squeak like a dog toy!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I bought several things for my baby to teethe on and she did not like any of them. She wouldn't &#34;chew&#34; on them. Finally when Sophie the Giraffe arrived our prayers were answered! She loves it and chews on it all the time especially the legs. I highly recommend this product.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Little baby love sucking and chewing on these little Sophie giraffes! I see so many fashionable little babies being strolled around the Rose Bowl with their little Sophies. Pretty cute how popular these teethers are!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My daughter loves to chew on Sophie.  It is easily gripped by babies and the squeak is such a surprise as they chew on any part of her.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I bought Sophie for my daughter after hearing rave reviews about her. We were not disappointed. We love Sophie! She's made of soft rubber, she squeaks, and she's the perfect size for little baby hands to hold on to. We actually lost her at the mall and had to order another one ASAP because my daughter loves her so much. She is absolutely worth every penny.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I got this for a Christmas gift for my eight month old, who is teething and putting everything in his mouth. He loves this toy. It is very soft and makes a squeaky sound if you touch it even the tiniest bit.  I was expecting a hard, bigger rubber toy, but this one is very malleable and is only about 7 or 8 inches tall. Easily washable. Love it!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Great price compared to other stores! My little girl loves it! Box was a little damaged but didn't matter since I wasn't giving as a gift.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,This is my four month olds favorite toy by far.  It's the only thing she can grasp and keep a hold of without getting frustrated.  My daughter is very active and this is the one toy that she'll sit still and gnaw on for minutes on end.  Definitely worth the money!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I got 1 Sopie each for both of my grandchildren. My grandson didn't seem interested in Sophie but my granddaughter loves her. They are both teething. I wouldn't have spent the money if I knew he wouldn't enjoy her. But you can't know these things. He may appreciate her some day. :-),4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I have busy four and two year olds and I can handle all their toys, except this one.  My kids love(d) it (especially my four year old who insisted on flinging it side-to-side by its neck for maximum annoyance) but I finally took scissors to that overpriced chew toy.  Problem solved.",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My 5 month old loves this toy! It's easy for her to hold, made of a very soft and durable material, and she'll chew on it for hours througout the day.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,my baby loves it! she loves the squeaking sound and giggles everytime she hits it. recommended item to other mothers.,4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"this is really a great item for baby, he adores it and it squeaks all over, i would def. recommend this item.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"We read and heard tons of great reviews of Sophie the Giraffe as our daughter started teething very early and got her first tooth by 6 months and at 8 months has 6 teeth.Pros: The overall design is good - lightweight allowing babies to grasp her easily and offers them a variety of things to chew on - a leg, her nose, a horn, etc.  Our daughter was able to hold it, pass it from one hand to the other and bring it up to her mouth whenever she wanted to chew on it.  The paint seemed to be on the plastic and did not seem to rub off; the plastic seems to be good quality in that it is very thick and durable for hard chewers.  We unfortunately had a hard time keeping it away from our small dogs because of the squeaky component because our daughter loved playing with it as much as chewing on it!Cons: the squeaky part of ours broke after a month.  It seemed to get dislodged because we could feel it inside and it felt like it came out of place but we couldn't fix it.  It also is hard to clean so that you don't get water inside it and compromise the squeaky part of it and/or simply trap water inside.Had ours not broken, we would have said it's maybe worth the money because it certainly kept our daughters attention more than other teethers she had, but we were quite disappointed that ours broke as we haven't used ours since.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Came in great condition. My son loves her. Totally worth the money. Wish I would have knew bout her back in the day.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I heard that it was the best teether and my daughter was lukewarm about it.  She played with it for the first three days and haven't really touched it since.  Its an ok teether but not worth what I paid for it.,3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My 5 month old loves Sophie! We gave it to him for Christmas and she's been one of his favorites every since. A little expensive, but worth it!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This is adorable, I love the story of it being created decades ago and still remaining exactly the same in virtually every way. My little 3 1/2 month old daughter is totally in love with it, we got her one for xmas,and really, it's the only toy we've seen her get in to so far - pretty cool! I'd say this is a highly recommended baby toy. not only is it ridiculously adorable, the squeak keeps them interested and there's all kinds of neato textures for your tiny one to chew on and explore - yum, this ones worth the pricey tag, it's a total keeper! A++++++++++ all the way!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,It is a dog toy. I gave it to my baby and the second she squeaked it my dog hovered over her. This toy is too dangerous for my baby to have around my dog. Not worth it,1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Yes, it's expensive.  But it works and it's cute.  Who cares when my son gnaws on Sophie and stops fussing due to teething pain?!  You can't fully wash it (immerse it in water) because water gets into the body, but you can easily sponge it down with soap, so it's all good.  Love it, but more importantly, my son loves her.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"The product is what I wanted and expected. However, the original box was dusty, almost torn; as though it was a used product. It seemed very odd to me. I paid for a new product and expected to receive the product and box in such conditions.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My grandson's new Favorite toy!!! I love it, because He loves it!!  All of his little friends in his play group also have a Sophie, I would recommend this little giraffe for any child, teething or not.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Sophie saved my life countless times during my childrens' teething months. That squeaky, chewy, irresistible toy is just the ticket. My babies would attack Sophie as soon as I pulled her out. And she's really cute too. When a parent finds something that saves their life, they tend to rave about it. I'm ravin'!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Sophie is pretty much the only teether my son cares for. I have to admit, I was a little skeptical when I ordered Sophie, but she really is worth the money. Knowing that your child is chewing on a toy that is completely safe, justifies the price. When the description said ""soft"", I was thinking like foam-like but it's a very soft plastic. It's easy to hold on to for my 4 month old. He loves to chew on Sophie's legs. We take her everywhere with us!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I love this giraffe, I think it is so cute. I thought it was a little expensive at first, but bought it anyway. It is very durable, my daughter used to chew on it when she was teething now she is 17 months and still plays with it on occasion. She can make it squeak now and she likes that.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I received two of these at my baby shower. I thought they were cute and then I opened one and gave it to my baby. IT SQUEAKS!!!!! It makes a high-pitched, dog-toy squeak that is obnoxious. That being said, the baby loves chewing on it and it is easy for her to hold. But that noise - it is awful. It is loud and draws attention. I will not take it with us to restaurants or even in the car.  It is so bad I have considered &#34;losing&#34; Sophie. I would never give this to another parent.",2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Our son refuses to take a paci, but loves to chew on things. We have had a hard time finding anything that keeps him interested for more than a few minutes (that isn't paper) but this Sophie has worked wonders! We first saw this at a friend's baby shower and I originally thought it was a dog's chew toy, but our son loved it so much I had to track one down. As expensive as it is compared to other teethers, for us it was well worth the purchase! The squeaker in side keeps him happy for longer periods of time than other teethers and the long legs and neck give him something to easily grip or chew on. Perfect!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,The Sophie Giraffe has been a favorite of my son since he was 2 1/2 months old and could hold it for short periods of time. He is now 8 months and still loves it. He uses it to chew on when he is teething and uses it to play with when he is not.  It was a great investment.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I saw online this was the ( IT ) teether. A lot of celebrity kids had it. I had to get it! I gave it to my baby at 4 months, she is 15 months now and still doesn't give a second thought to the thing. It is cute though. But I am out 20$ for nothing.",2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Our baby loves this.  Would like to see more products of this quality. The packaging is great and even includes a short story of how the product is made.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I personally liked this teething toy given that it was made in France that it was natural rubber.  A lot of products now tout BPA free, but what are they actually made of?  How do we know that it's really any better than the materials that contained BPA in the 1st place?But after a year and a half of me trying to get her to gnaw on it, she still won't.  She's getting molars now so I thought for sure that I could get her to chew on Sophie's legs.  She's just not into it, but will chew on other teethers.  It doesn't do me a lot of good to have this product if it's not being used...hence the mediocre 3 stars.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This is a wonderful, smooth, firm, delightful chewing toy -so it's really a shame we can't use it.  The giraffe's legs are so long that my daughter is always gagging herself with them.  Other reviewers describe babies actually choking on the legs, which is scary.  It's otherwise so well thought out, this flaw is bizarre.  It ought to be recalled and corrected.  They DO make another teether -it looks like a little alien- with no long appendages and she loves it, so I would recommend that instead (look for Vulli Teether)",2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I got this as a gift. My baby loves chewing on Sophie's ears. I do like it that it's natural and painted with food paint. But I'm not sure I'd pay almost $20 for this. It's a good product but a bit pricy for a teething toy.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My son really liked the giraffe until the sqeaker stopped working.  It didn't seem to withstand all the drool.  But it is soft enough for him at 4 months that he really enjoyed chewing on it.,3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,After barely a week with this ""amazing"" teether - the rubber is peeling! Small bits of the bottom of the feet are breaking off. I couldn't believe it after seeing such great reviews. Pretty scary to see rubber missing from your child's toy - especially after paying $16! I would have expected better quality for the price. Amazon made it an easy return though!,1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I received this as a gift two years ago with my first daughter, who loved it.  Now my second daughter has adopted it and loves it even more.  Excellent quality, easy to clean, and both my girls love it!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I got this Vulli Sophie for my 3 month old and he loves it !!! It is so so cute!!!My 2 year old Loves is too!!!!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Got the product when my baby was 4 months and she only stared to play with it at 9 months. She likes it a lot the only problem is that the paint is starting to come off. I would give the product 4 stars but with the money I spent on it I would have expected better quality.,3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Yes, we have a back up just in case. I know parents that have had to run out in the middle of the night to buy a replacement when theirs was misplaced.  I see these with almost every baby when we are out and for good reason.  Sophie is durable, great to chew on, and pleasant to see and squeak.  Boy or girl, Sophie is a winner and a great gift.  I gave one to our niece and seems to be the gift to give when we have a new addition. You will know this toy is worth every penny when it entertains and serves as a teether.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I bought Sophie for my 4 month old granddaughter who is showing signs of teething. Dispite her limited ability to grasp toys, Sophie's design fits easily into her tiny hands and quickly has become our families go to toy to comfort her in her fussiness. A commonly heard phrase in our home is &#34;Where's Sophie?&#34;",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I ordered the two pack for two different grandbabies who will be born soon.  Each giraffe came in its own box which was helpful since they were separate gifts.  It is amazing how popular this toy is with teething babies.  Those soft legs must feel just right on those tiny gums.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,,4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,You can't go wrong with Sophie. I've never met a baby who didn't like this toy. Product arrived on time and as described.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Our son really likes Sopie...the problem is that with every smile he has from her squeaker, so too are our dogs summoned to Sophie...at which point they try to be sneaky and steal her.  I know that there will be one morning that I forget to put her out of reach and they'll swiftly tear her apart.  But this is the price we pay for having 4-legged and 2-legged children.  My son enjoys this toy for the squeaker and due to the ease at which he can hold it.  His small mouth (4 months old) has some difficulty chewing on her.  He chews her ears, but I think he wishes they were a little bigger so he could get them further back (if they made a bunny rabbit it would be perfect for him).  I considered getting the smaller Sophie teether, but I figured that he could grow into this one.  Overall, it's a good purchase and I know our son will be searching out Sophie among his other toys.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I was so looking forward to getting this for my little girl, but from the second I opened the box I was disappointed.  It didn't smell like vanilla rubber; it smelled like latex.  I don't get HOW it can be called a teether.  It is a squeak toy.  Period.  It is completely hollow and has an obnoxious squeak when you barely even touch it.  It is so flexible that I don't see how a- it can be safe (which reading some of the other negative reviews I now see that it probably isn't safe) or b- can be effective.  This thing gives at the slightest touch, so how can it possibly aid in cutting teeth or massaging the gums?Additionally, you cannot sterilize this toy.  So... let's see.  My baby got thrush when she was only 2 weeks old and I had to sterilize everything that came in contact with her mouth.  What would I have done with this then?  And she just got over her first cold, so again everything was sterilized.  You need to sterilize things with a baby- you just do.  How can this be a toy that you can't sterilize?!?I will be going to Barnes and Noble tomorrow to compare and see if this is the same as what they have there, but either way I'm sorely disappointed in this purchase.  I've bought dog toys that would have made better teethers.  Heck, I have a baby Garanimals water toy giraffe that would be a safer and more effective teether.  **I have two other toys by Vulli and they DO HAVE the natural rubber smell.  This is going back to Amazon.**",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I'm not sure why Sophie is such a hit with the little ones, but my 7 month old baby girl is one of her adoring fans.  The rubber is softer and more pleasant to handle, and my daughter has enjoyed chewing on her legs and the nubs on her head even before she started teething.  She also loves the squeak that Sophie makes when you squeeze her.  Not sure what it is but if Sophie is amongst a pile of her other toys, my daughter will more often than not reach for Sophie.  And I have the peace of mind of knowing that only edible and safe paints and materials have been used to make Sophie, as opposed to Bright Starts and other baby toys made in China.  Now that the research is out on phthalates and other toxic substances in baby toys, I think it's more important than ever to find good quality toys that are also safe for our babies to handle and put in their mouths.  Sophie is a must-have for every new mom in my opinion.  Even if your kid is one of the few that can take or leave her, it's worth a try.  Vulli, the makers of Sophie, also make natural rubber teething rings that my daughter loves as well.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I got this for my baby shower before our little guy was born, he has loved it since he was about 2 months old. When he was very little he loved to hear the squeak that Sophie makes and he liked to watch her dance (we were making her dance). When he started teething at 4 months (and continuing to now when he is a year) this has worked so much better for him than teething rings. He shoves one of her foot/legs into whatever corner of his mouth is hurting and starts chomping. The rings only work for the front of babies mouths, Sophie can fit in all corners!! Sophie is a bit more expensive than most teethers but she has a lot going for her. She is made of all natural rubber, from France (no risk of China getting lead into this lady!), super sturdy, and still entertains my one year old! The price here on Amazon is also better than you can find practically anywhere.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My baby girl started to teethe early, but I didn't want to spend $20 on what looked like a dog squeaky toy.  I have read the reviews, and have other mommy friends that swore by this toy. Finally when she was 4 months old, I broke down and ordered it from Amazon when it was on sale for $18.I cannot believe how much my baby adores this thing. At 11 months old, she is working on tooth #8...and STILL loves to play with Sophie. It doesn't hurt that my baby LOVES giraffes...but I believe this toy soothes in ways I cannot even imagine. It is made of very soft rubber and it does squeak. She loves to chew on the feet and her nose. After a while the paint does start to wear off, but I doubt its harmful.If you are debating on whether or not to get this for your baby, then you should. I know it seems crazy, but it works!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,This little Sophie has so many angles to it and is so soft and managable by the littlest baby.  One of the first things they coordinate.  It also is a soft teething toy and very durable.  I highly recommend Sophie as a gift or accessory to the main gift.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My 5mo daughter is completely in love with Sophie the Giraffe and so am I.  My daughter's been playing with Sophie since she was about 2 months old.  Her face lights up and she reaches for Sophie when we show it to her.  She loves to chew on Sophie's ears, nose and legs and she gets excited when she makes her squeak.  I love Sophie because she's made from natural rubber and I don't have to worry that my daughter's chewing and sucking on something that may be slowly poisoning her.  Sophie's a great gift for a new baby!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I almost gagged when my wife showed me the price but my little guy loves it.  The texture on it is great and it has proven very durable.  The squeaker in it has suffered all kinds of abuses and it is still going strong.  Hands down the best teether we have used.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,We have found Sophie to be a much better teether once my son got older and started working on back teeth. He wasn't interested much when he was little but now that he's two it's great when those back teeth are bugging him.  Gives him something to provide a little relief other than gnawing holes in a binky.,4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I was very pleased with our Sophie the Giraffe. It is easy for baby to hold and chew on. The only bad thing about it is that it smells really bad when you get it out of the box.,4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I bought Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether for my niece Winny.  It is now her favorite toy.  She carries this giraffe with here everywhere.  I really score big points buying this for her.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Great toy... easy washes... The only problem I've had is my son chokes on the legs all the time... maybe he should stop trying to eat the toy... I wish more of this brand was sold locally...,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My daughter loves this product but the long legs can be a choking hazard. Please be careful because my daughter loves to chew on this toy.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I thought for sure that his teether was all hype but low and behold- my little guy LOVES it! It is by far his favorite thing to chew on. I definitely recommend it!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,A great teething product. The sweetest face and the feel good to the gums feeling it gives babies is exceptional.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I had read great reviews on the Sophie so I decided to get one for my six month old son.  He loves it!  He was just starting to get his teeth when we purchased it and while he was resistant to chewing on other teethers, he went straight for the ears and legs when we gave him the Sophie.  He likes the sounds it makes too.  Even though this item is a bit over-priced, I would highly recommend it!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,was a big hit with the teething two year old i have it to.  became his constant companion and his mother loved that it soothed him through teething.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,After reading many reviews on Amazon I decided to buy this for my daughter. She is 6 months now and loves Sophie. Sophie is so flexible for baby's little mouth. She enjoys it. I agree with others that you dont have to buy any other teether once you buy this. It also makes sound when you press her and that amuses my baby so much. Mommy & baby love this product.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Sophie is the teething choice in our family. A real winner with all the grandchildren. Great toy even for just play time.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Let me just start off by addressing the choking ""issue"" I keep reading about. Please don't leave your child unattended with this toy (or most toys), and you won't have to worry about choking.  I'm pretty sure the instructions probably say that, but in this case it's especially important- I can see how the back legs could get wedged-but the long legs are why baby loves it so much!Moving on, hubby was WAY skeptical about putting this on our registry (and then buying it when no one purchased it for us).  He said ""that had better be one magical toy"".  And now he admits that it is, and that it was worth the money.Our little guy adores his Sophie, and it was one of the first toys he could hold onto and chew on, starting when his chewing obsession began around 2 months.  Now, at almost 9 months, he's still chewing away, and also adores playing ""Peekaboo"" with Sophie, when she squeaks just out of sight, and then appears.My only (very minor) complaints are that 1) it can be a bit of a dirt attracter because of the material (as are the other silicone-type teethers- not just specific to Sophie).  2) If you have a dog, they may think the toy is theirs.  We can't send Sophie along to the babysitter's house because her dog goes nuts.Overall, a MUST HAVE baby item.  No question.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Great product the baby smiled right away when she saw it. She started to chew on it right away and love the squeak noise it makes.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I loved reading the story that comes with Sophie, about how this toy is made just as it was in 1956, in the same process from the same all natural materials (tree sap or natural rubber).  I have tried dozens of teether toys with both my daughters, my 5 month old loves chewing on sophie's feet or head. She smiles when I squeak her. if I give her one of the wooden teething toys she cries (too hard and big/heavy) and if I give her the plastic rings, she also cries (again I think too hard). Sophie is amazingly soft and seems very durable. I have not seen any fading of the colors at all. Wonderful toy, worth the price.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Well I never used it because I haven't teethed in quite some time. I sent it to my niece who I only see a couple times a year.  I think it either got lost in the million other toys or became a dog toy.  It was pretty cute though.  I hope she liked it. What do I care? She's a baby.  She's not going to remember little Sophie.  But perhaps it made her feel better and now she won't go into the rest of her childhood with this nagging unhappiness hangover from infancy.  Who knows?  Like the title says, nice giraffe.  Maybe I will get myself one.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I wasn't sure about the cost of this teether, but it's well worth it. Easy for my 5 month old to hold onto, squeaks but not too annoying.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My Mom-in-Law bought Sophie for my son when he was just starting to really chew on things (and we were hearing some pretty scary things about toys not made in the USA). She did some research and came across Sophie and we are so glad that she did! While Sophie doesn't come from the USA, we love the fact that she is 100% safe and natural, and my son loves to play with her. I also love how soft Sophie is, my son tends to swing his toys around and when he's sitting on my lap I'm usually in danger of being hit in the face with whatever he's holding, needless to say a soft toy is even better in my book! There's one last thing I want to comment on, I've read reviews that said that Sophie was a ""glorified dog toy"" or something to that effect, and I don't want to seem rude, but I think they're crazy! Yes Sophie does squeak, (which my son didn't care about much at first but now he loves) but that's about as far as the comparison could go! If you want a quality teething toy for your child then look no further! Sophie is adorable, soft, perfect for little hands, 100% natural, and SAFE!!!!!!! Definitely worth every penny!!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This is a great teething toy, he loves it and loves the squeaking, this is easy to grasp and handle. Could not be more happier with the purchase of this item",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Before I had my son my mind was made up to eventually buy Sophie, today he is 4 months old and finally has her. My impression of her after opening the box is that she is bigger and more bulky than I had pictured and really would make a great dog toy, when my dogs hear her they think so too. My son seems to like her quite a bit, she is very easy for him to pass from hand to hand which he doesnt do with other toys. Upon shoving her in his mouth for the first time he immediately removed her and stuck his tongue out like he was trying to make the taste go away. The expression was priceless. Needless to say he still tries chewing on her though her head is way too big to fit in his mouth and seems to be his favorite part. At first I wondered why did I pay so much for this but I dont regret buying Sophie at all.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I have given this as a gift several times and all the moms come back to me and rave about how awesome this teether is and that their child loved it! It does seem slightly pricey for what is really a plastic chew toy, but if it soothes your child it's worth it!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I was very skeptical and read all the 'horror' stories of Sophie being unsafe, but my daughter was having a hard time teething, so I bought it.  My daughter loves Sophie, I have no idea what it is, but she just gets the biggest smile when I pull her out.  Like others have said - I just use common sense with it, any toy can potentially be dangerous, I watch her with it and don't let her have it in the car where I cannot see what's going on.  But she has never even come close to choking or having any sort of danger with this teether.  It has definitely helped with her teething and I'd recommend it to anyone.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"At first my little guy wasn't sure about this thing and I was thinking I had wasted my money on what seemed like a dog sqeek toy... but once he figured out how to hold and chew on it,  he now  loves it! We're in the early stages of teething so it goes where ever he goes!I have even gone as far as to put a pacifer clip around it's leg so that it doesn't get thrown on the floor in the car. I think this is the best teether out there, a must have for a teething kiddo.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I think this teether has ""baby nip"" in it! My baby loves this teether, and this keeps her occupied in the car too! Great product, must for a baby shower gift!!!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"AND IT IS!  Sofie is soft, gnawable, and her belly sqeaks.  My 4.5 month old son likes to gnaw her hooves, try to tear her legs apart, and gun her ears.  Sofie and a wubbanub (and Peppa Pig TV) make our lives so much easier.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Yes, it's imported. Yes, it's expensive. And yes, I love it and so does my baby girl! This giraffe is made of natural rubber. It is so easy for my five month old to hold onto and to chew. She especially loves the legs, though she recently found the head and has begun to chew on Sophie's ears, horns and mouth. Sophie also makes a squeaky noise. My girl can chew on Sophie for a long time and she doesn't get frustrated because it is so easy to stick Sophie into her mouth. So far, this has been her favorite toy to chew on.  I've read some reviews where people say their children didn't like Sophie.  I think it's inevitable that some kids won't like Sophie.  But personally, I think it's worth a try.  If your baby likes Sophie, she will be a great toy.  If not, hey, give Sophie away to another mom to try with her baby.  Also, I think trying a toy over and over again may help.  My little girl didn't quite get Sophie right away at four months, but I kept putting Sophie in front of her and encouraging her by sticking one of Sophie's legs in her mouth.  It took her a couple days, but once she understood she could chew away easily on Sophie, she loved her!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My son absolutely loves this toy.  He is able to chew on it for hours and loves that it squeaks when he bites it just right or hits it.  It is soft and pliable but sturdy enough that it won't rip or wear out.  He loves the many different angles of the toy because he can get the legs far back in his mouth or he can run his gums along the bumpy spine.  This is an absolute must have for any baby who is teething.  I never leave home without it.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My little guy loves Vulli, it's one of the only toys he can squeak, (much to the dismay of my dog).  He just started really getting a grip on his toys and Vulli seems very easy for him to handle, bring to his mouth, squeak, etc.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My daughter was given this toy as a gift for her baby from her sister.  Her baby has loved  this toy from the moment he learned to use his hands. When we lost it we immediately had to purchase another one. It is great for teething babies that are learning how to put things in their mouths. The only bad thing is the squeak sounds a lot like a dog toy - so if you have dogs that like squeaky toys they may mistake this for one of their toys!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My daughter loves this toy so much. She will drag it around the house everywhere she goes! She has so much fun playing with it.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My baby absolutely loves sophie! Even my three year old loves playing with her. I need to order another one.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Paint peeling off just a month later. I paid a lot of money for this overpriced dog toy, so I had hoped for better quality, especially with all the hype surrounding it. But my son loves it, so he will have his silly, blank giraffe for a while, I guess.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"The Teething Giraffe worked great for my 7 month old son. Yes it is expensive for a teether, but he loves it still and I do think it has helped him trhough this rough phase of his baby life!!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Its the perfect size for small baby hands.  Its soft and light and easy for little ones to play with.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Sophie the Giraffe is the best teether!  My son loves it and now I buy one for all my pregnant friends as shower gifts!  Great!!!!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This is a glorified dog toy, it feels like one, it squeaks like one, I thought it was something special from all of the good reviews but it is not. You can buy 3x the amount of good teethers for the price. Honestly people were asking why my son had a dog toy.",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I ordered this teether because of all of the wonderful things that I had seen and heard. I was more excited to open it and see it that my 5 month old daughter was to use it. Although she will play with it and chew on it every now and then, she seems just as interested in it as she is with all of her other teething toys. I am still waiting for her to fall in love with it. I didn't mind the price, because most good teethers run around the $12-18 range and nothing is too much as long as my baby is happy. Maybe when she gets to the painful teething stage, she will use it more. For now, I think this teether is just overrated.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My daughter is 5 months and loves her Sophie.  The shape and size are perfect for her to grab and chew on.  She loves that Sophie squeeks.  The only issue we have had is that the dog thinks it is her toy!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I got Sophie for my baby girl when she was 3 months old. She absolutely loves her. Chews everywhere: head, nose, ears, legs. Satisfies her desire to chew & suck. She can independently hold this toy w/o difficulty. It is definitely her favorite toy!!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"We've only had Sophie a couple of weeks and my son loves her.  Unfortunately, she's losing her voice -- way too soon for the investment!!!",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My daughter loves her Sophie, we don't go any where with out it. Got it when she was 3 months and now that she is 6 she loves it even more. Will definitely recommend it. Worth the money.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I have this for my son.I bought for my friend 's baby.I  highly recommended.But I don't know how to see real one or not.I hope this is real one.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I had one of these when I was a child, and bought one for my son.  He LOVES it!!  The first moment out of the package he was reaching for it.  Now he chews on it all the time.  The giraffe is made of soft plyable rubber that bends easy but doesn't tear/rip.  It is perfect for little hands to grab onto.  It wipes clean with a wet cloth or baby wipe.  The coloring doesn't rub off.  It is a great toy!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I have purchased several of these teethers for many baby showers.  It is always well received and liked by the new baby.,4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Ever since my daughter received this is as a baby and loved it, I always get this for every one of my friends who has a new baby.  It is adorable, and very easy to squeak...making it a joy for little babies to play with.  Amazon has the best price by far. This product has become very popular in stores and often sells for over $20! Thank you Amazon for always providing what I'm looking for at a great price!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"We were given this toy for our daughter when she was about three months old.  She loved Sophie instantly and even at 17 months she still plays with it.  The legs are very soft, but still firm enough to help with a little one teething.  Though Sophie has seen many hours of chewing she shows no signs of wearing out or coming apart.  The only thing we have noticed is that the spots and hoof coloring did start to fade with chewing.  All in all we loved getting this as it was something we would not have likely purchased on our own but have since gotten it for others for shower gifts.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I received this as a baby shower gift and I wasn't thinking of reviewing it one way or another but it's listed as #1 in Baby and that surprises me, especially after reading all these reviews with people having their babies choke on the legs.  Thankfully that hasn't happened with my daughter yet, but I'm not going to take a chance.  She seems bored by Sophie anyway (she's almost 5 months old) and if it's possible she could choke on Sophie I'm going to throw it away.  Save your money, not worth it.",2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My daughter is four months old and is starting to teeth. I am one the buys off reviews and this toy has high ratings, so for the price I thought why not.  When we fisrt received it I was all excited. We washed it and started to play with her with it.  She won't have anything to do with it. I even tried to get her to ""chew"" on the legs, but to no avail.  I've noticed from day one it has a yucky rubbery smell to it. Washed several times and can't get the smell to go away. The squeaker sounds just like a dog toy, my puppy goes nuts when we accidently hit it.I will state the neck is perfect for her little hands to grab, and it goes with us in her toy bag every where we go... maybe someday she'll like it.Editing my review... My daughter is now 6 1/2 months old and sophie has become her one of her favorite toys.... it still smells several washes later and my dog still goes nuts, but my baby loves it.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This was the one toy our son just had to have all the time. It was excellent for teething. We buy this for every friend who has a baby, truly the best teether we could find and it's totally safe too.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"After getting this for my baby and after she sucked a good amount of the paint off I read that amazon's Sophie's were fake.  I scoured the Internet looking for ways to distinguish the real Sophie's from the fakes.  I found that this Sophie had the right markings, no obvious mistakes and came with one of the right lot or batch number so I chalked up the running eye paint to it being natural.  But then I saw Sophie's in a local Children's retail store and I realized mine was fake after all!  The real Sophie's eyes do not smear when rubbed or sucked on.  The real Sophie was slightly more slender and toned looking.  She was more flexible, you can easily fold her over and squeeze her cheeks in making her squeak with very little pressure. Just tapping her on the body while she is laying down makes her squeak, whereas the fake Sophie is slightly stiffer so you have to deliberately squeeze her to make her squeak. Do not take the chance with these, find a local retailer through their OFFICIAL site, not a fake Sophie website and order through them!  www.vulli-toys.com is the site on the box.  Hope this helps!",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I purchased this for my 4 month old becasue he is teething, he loves it and will chomp on it all day! The squeeking one that I got him will make him laugh to as she is chewing it :)",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I bought this for my son when he was 5 months old.  He LOVES it!!!!  He will spit out his pacifier to chew on Sophie.  I love knowing that it's natural and non-toxic, and I have been raving about it to anyone who will listen!  I'll be giving this as a baby gift for anyone who is expecting!!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This teether is a perfect size and weight for a baby's little hands.  It's soft and very flexible.  Because no part of it is very big in diameter, it's easy for my baby to grasp and hold on to without dropping it.  The little squeak it makes is a cute addition.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I thought my three month old daughter was too young for something like this.  I was wrong.  She loves it.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My baby loved Sophie but after reading on Vulli website certain batches have been recalled in June 2013 due to high levels of toxicity by the German manufacturer, I would not give this to your child.  Not worth taking a chance since baby puts this in mouth...",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Our daughter received this cute little toy as a gift, and we have really been enjoying it - until we realized that the paint has been coming off! I am really sad to say that even though she loves it, it has to go. I have been reading the reviews looking to see if anyone else has had this problem and also learned about the choking issues.  I am very upset about this.",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"We pulled it out of the package and  washed it off, and my 6 month old reached for it and started chewing!  This has been a great toy/teether for her and I am pleased with the product.  It is very easy for her to hold.  I gave it 4 stars because I do think it is quite expensive for a teething toy, but the product itself is great.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Soft, easy to grab for my 11 m old. He's disabled, so it was nice to find a toy that he could hang onto more easily than others. Soothes his teething gums also. It's one of his favorite toys, if not his favorite.Only problem I have is that the ears look a bit worn, as if someone bought, used and returned it.P.S. DON'T RINSE UNDER WATER. It will stop squeaking. Thankfully After wacking it several times, I got the microscopic amount of water dislodged. It squeaks just fine again. Read instruction manual.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I had never heard of Sophie before I had a child.  Apprently the toy has been around for almost 50 years.  My 4 month old loves her.  I hesitated to spend so much on an infant toy(over $20 including shipping).  However this is really the only toy she plays with right now.  I don't have a dog, but if you have one, the dog might mistake it for its own toy.  To a human though, you can really tell that Sophie is high quality.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Wife had to have this for our grandson.  He loves it, and used if for his first tooth. I'm sure it won't be the last thing we buy him",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"When we got home from playschool today, we had a package waiting by the door. It was Sophie!! My daughter is 9 weeks old and until today she had no toys! I opened the box and held Sophie in front of my baby. She stared intently at the cute little toy and her hands started to open and close.I put Sophie where baby could reach and she grabbed hold of her! Perfect size for a baby toy and so soft! I can imagine it will be great when baby gets to teething too. I can see how some call it a glorified dog toy, but it is not made of the same stinky rubber as a dog toy and the paint on Sophie is food grade. I think the price is a little high but we believe in only buying the kids a few well made quality toys rather than a bunch of cheap plastic junk.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Our son is teething and has been for about a month.  He just doesn't like this toy.  Even if he did like it, I'd still feel like a sucker.  Overpriced!",2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"All my grandbabies love this toy. It smells good, and apparently tasts great, because they love to chew on it.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Easy to wash and babies easily grabs it with their little fingers. Natural food based coloring and ruber. No smell,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,A favorite among parents for a reason- my baby is enjoying it at 5 months old and will like it even better when she is coordinated enough to chew the areas she'd like to!,4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I seriously wonder why my 3 month old is obsessed with this silly thing?!  It is seriously a dog toy!  She got 5 as gifts!!  But hey, she really likes it, so 5 stars it is!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My wife and I got this for our grandson and it worked like a charm during teething.  He seemed to like it as a little toy friend, as well.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Definitely worth the money and stands up to all the hype. I still feel it is a little over priced for what it is, but my baby loves it and it was withstood A TON of chews : ) I like that it's made of natural products and is easy to clean, my baby loves how it feels on her sore gums. Would have given a 5 star review if it was a few dollars cheaper.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I know I am late in reviewing this product...like 3 years late. I bought this before you could get it in in stores. Now you see her everywhere. I still have this thing in my daughters room, and she is 3. She loved this thing so much that I can't get myself to get rid of her. Everyone laughed at me, saying that I was giving my child a dog toy to chew on, if they had a teething baby then they would understand! Like I said, both me and my daughter loved Sophia",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"First of all, Sophie arrived in plenty of time for Christmas&#8230;the delight for the family is when my 4 month old grandson loved it too.  Sophie is everything  that was pictured; I am very happy with my purchase.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I won't know for a while if my new Granddaughter to be will like this teether; but it's cute!  I think any baby would love it.  Not to mention my Grand-dogs....they think they will get it if they beg long enough....not a chance!!  NOT at the price I paid for it! LOL,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Pros: Our little one loves this thing. Everytime we squeak it she lights up.Cons: It gets really slobbery.Pro again: Sophie dries real quick.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"We got one of these non-assuming looking little giraffe teethers a few months ago as a gift for my 8 month old son and let me tell you - he loves chewing on it. It has a great build quality to it with thick areas in the head and feet, and a squeaky in its center area. When my son is grumpy and trying to take a nap, this is his go to toy for chewing. It looks like a simply doggy toy - but it is much better built quality than that. Really, though it isn't cheap, you are getting what you pay for. This is a teether your child will lock onto and you won't have to worry about it breaking apart and hurting him. I recommend it.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My granddaughter loved hers and got great teething pain relief from it.  Bought this one as a shower gift for a friend.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"we are having a baby in December, so baby has not had a chance to try it out yet. but our friends who have this teether all agree that it is a wonderful invention!  can't wait to try it!",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I wish I knew about this item months ago.  My 1 year old grandson loves giraffes and has been teething for months.  Sophie is a perfect size and perfect material.  The squeeker is a bonus.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"""Sophie the Giraffe"" has tested positive for potentially cancer causing nitrosamines. Nitrosamines are known carcinogens that are illegal in baby bottles and pacifiers in Europe.  In France this has caused a big debate about both journalism and marketing of non-toxic toys. Sophie is marketed as being one of the safest toys out there.  If she has nitrosamines in her, that doesn't seem quite right.Vulli, the company that has made Sophie the Giraffe for fifty years, quickly released a statement saying their toy was safe. The report was covered by another very reputable French newspaper Le Figaro.So who is telling the truth?  I'm not sure. But here's the thing, I don't want to take chances with my daughter's health.  I know that many plastics and chemicals are potentially dangerous to young children, and I also understand that there are safer alternatives for companies to use.  It is my understanding that even though nitrosamines occur naturally they are still dangerous for babies to ingest.",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I got a Sophie in the mail from a secret santa.  All my daughter's other teething toys are so hard she manages to hurt herself on them and the fabric one become quickly soaked with saliva... this is where Sophie rules the school!Her soft rubber is the perfect texture for my little girl, her limbs, neck and head all provide comfortable grips for her tiny hands, and she is solid enough to take a real beating in my little girl's mouth.A SUPERIOR baby product and one of my favorites as a mom so far.  BUY THIS PRODUCT!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Kids apparently love this little giraffe. It's cute and seems to work well for teething (from what I've heard from moms). I still usually recommend frozen 'stuff' to my patients, because from what feedback I have received, cold stuff feels really good on the sore gum tissue around erupting teeth.  However, for those outings/trips when having frozen items is not an option, this seems like a good alternative. I'll probably buy one for my kiddo when the time comes.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Absolutely wonderful product! The baby loves it so we love it! Sophie is the best investment we have made so far!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Great product.... one minute there noise the next silence. This is a magical thing. It keeps my daughters attention and allows me to have a moment of silence.,4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This giraffe is adorable, soft, and easy for little hands to grasp.  It is light weight and good for biting.  It has a squeak sound that is not annoying and the baby has to play with it for a while to figure out how to get it to squeak.  All the materials used are non-toxic.  I love this and wish I had had one for each of my kiddos.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,This is not just cute but my 4 month old smiles every time it squeeks. He started to grab things better now and love this one and of course the first thing is to get it in his mouth. Love the giraffe neck because it give him the ability to hold it. Very nice product!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,all of my children (4) never liked any teething toy. I would spend lots of money on cheap teething toys then trow them away. This is the very first one that my infant LOVES and takes everywhere with him.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Great teether and toy.  I don't agree with the doggie toy comments, it's better quality than that.  So what it squeaks, kids love that.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I bought this for my Grandson and he loves it. A word of warning...so will a dog.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Worth every penny IMO. My son loves this toy. It's a great teether and when he is fussy it gets him out of his funk!! Love it!!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"We got this little giraffe as a gift from a friend who married a Frenchman. I've never heard of it before, but apparently it's a cultural icon of sorts in France. It is a neat little that helps babies with teething, motor skills and in all sorts of other little ways. Sure enough, our baby new exactly what to do with it once he got a hold of little Sophie. He started biting her and mauling her in the most savage ways imaginable, and Sophie took all of it in stride without blinking an eye (literally).So far the toy seems well made and durable. I don't think that there is a material object known to man that can in a long run withstand everything that infants can do to it, but with that caveat in place I am very happy with the quality of this teething toy. Would definitely recommend it to other parents out there.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"A little pricey, but durable and so good to know no harmful substances used in manufacture of this delightful teether.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,What can I say! Everybody loves a Sophie. I have given this teething toy many times and the kiddies love her!  I even found a child's book to match!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I bought this toy for my daughter becauase it has such a long, proven history, plus it is made of non-toxic matieral.  Ella absolutely loved it, and I buy it as a baby gift for all my friend now.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I bought this product to know what is exactly the boom of this little toy, and it is lovely, my little kid just love it, it is easy to manage and there is not danger in leaving him alone with it. We really like, and I do not doubt in giving my recommendation to someone who is thinking in buying, to sum up, if you are looking a teether for your bab@s Vulli Sophie the Giraffe is the best recommendation and it is perfect as a gift.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I received this as a baby shower gift and had never heard of it before. Imagine my surprise when I see it's the #1 seller on amazon baby! My son didn't take much interest in it at all until 4 months or so when he started getting his first teeth. It is very easy for him to grasp and bring up to his mouth to chew on. He especially loves chewing on the feet. However it is not usually the toy he reaches for, and shows so much more interest in other things. I know many moms and babies love it, and it is very high quality, but I would have never payed for it myself. And the dog thinks it's a a dog toy because it squeeks, so that is just kind of gross.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Easy for baby to hold and she loves it!  Just the right textures with easy gripping.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This is the best teething toy my kids have ever had.  Both of my boys gnawed on her much to their relief and mine.I can't recommend Sophie enough.  She's durable, cute and she's a classic.When my now 7 year-old son was a baby, you could only get Sophie in Europe.  Thank goodness she made the trip.Buy two!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Seems like a nice idea but my kid didn't really take to it.I like the idea that it is all natural and it is cute.My baby just prefers his fist in his mouth. Ha ha,3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My wife found Sophie and we ordered it, at first our son didn't know what to think of it, but a few hours later he was biting it and grabbing it and now he always looks for it and smiles when he sees it.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"As every mom knows, you always want to give your children the best you can.  Though I thought it was a bit expensive, I had read many good reviews about the Vulli Sophie Giraffe Teether and wanted to get one for my baby girl.  And because Sophie is made from all natural rubber and decorated with food-grade coloring, I felt it would be worth the extra money to have the peace of mind knowing that there are no toxic paints, plastics, or dangerous small parts for my daughter to ingest.  She has had an easy time teething (she has 2 lower center teeth with 4 coming in on top and 2 more on the bottom), but she still likes to chew on her little Sophie Giraffe.  Sophie's long skinny neck and legs are easy for my daughter's small hands to hold.  My little girl loves to nibble on Sophie's ears, horns, and feet.  Plus, I think this little giraffe is just so cute.  Also, just as an anecdote: When I first offered Sophie to my daughter, she was NOT interested.  The squeak was a bit loud for her, and the natural rubber taste was different for her.  I thought I may have wasted $18.  However, over time, my daughter has really come to like Sophie.  She will smile and reach for Sophie when I offer it to her, and she seems to enjoy chewing on Sophie.  I am glad I bought this teether, and because it is gender neutral, I know I can use it in the future whether I have another girl or a boy.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My 7 mo. nephew immediately started playing with and chewing on the teether. He seemed to prefer it over his many other Christmas gifts. It was well worth the price, and his parents appreciated it as well.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My daughter is 11 months old and she still loves Sophie.  It is one of the toys that I rotate in the car because my dog won't leave Sophie alone if she is in the house.  I also stick Sophie in the diaper bag for a quick distraction.  My daughter is working on her molars now and is able to stick Sophie's legs way back in her mouth.  You can put links around Sophie's neck to attach her to the stroller.  I smile every time I hear the little squeak coming from the backseat :),5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Good size for my 5 month old to grab and chew. She loves it. I don't think all the packaging is really necessary though,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I have tried other teethers with my five month old and she hates the taste of them.  She loves chewing on Sophie's face.  Gave it four stars instead of five because the legs are so close together it is hard for her to chew on them.,4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My son loves teh Giraffe. It is his favor toy to chew on. It is soft,the baby can grab it very easily.It makes a funny noice. Great toy for every kid.Love it.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,This toy is worth every penny. My daughter loved this toy at 3 months and still adores it at 6 months. It is her favorite toy by far. The legs and neck are skinny enough that she can grasp it in her tiny hands. Nothing heavy or hard that she can hurt herself with when she flails it around. The head and body squeak and make her laugh. Great for teething. I always keep Sophia in my diaper bag.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I went back and forth for awhile deciding if I wanted to spend this much for something that is pretty much a dog toy, but I'm glad I did. Baby loves to stick the legs all the way to the back of his mouth to reach the back gums that pacis don't reach. And the squeek makes him laugh. The only complaints I have are that when I wash it it tends to hold water and is hard to get it all out. And the painted on spots and face are fading, I'm guessing from washing it but if its going in the mouth its gonna be clean.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I admit, I didn't get Sophie the Giraffe at first when my mom insisted I had to get it for my baby daughter.  It was a fancy squeaky teether and that was that.Well, I get it now.  Babies love Sophie.  My baby loves Sophie.This little giraffe is absolutely darling.  Cute face, adorable spots, just one sweet package.And the squeaking.  This thing squeaks if you look at it hard enough, so my daughter loves to bite on the head, body, etc.  The rubber is nice and soft and great for little gums.My own complaint is the paint.  No, I'm not worried about it being harmful to my baby, but having purchased two different Sophies (one at a store, one here on Amazon) and having both fade eventually does cause me to frown.  I get this is the nature of the dye, but it does keep this from being perfect.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Everyone on here was right. Sophie is incredible. Sophie can win a game of connect four in only three moves. When Alexander Bell invented the telephone he had 3 missed calls from Sophie. Seriously, our boy loves this thing. He enjoys chewing on it and she is the perfect size for his little hands.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This giraffe is very cute, and I'm sure my daughter would have loved it. But as soon as I received the item (purchased from Dainty Baby) I followed the directions to wash the item with soapy water and a washcloth, and the paint started rubbing off (and I've since read about the same thing happening in other reviews). Whether it's safe (food dye?) paint or not, I'm not comfortable my baby ingesting anything from a toy.",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I was extremely skeptical about buying a $25 teething toy shaped like a giraffe. But since the price was around $17 here on Amazon, I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did! I didn't want to believe it, but there is just something about this giraffe teether that babies love! I have a 6 month old, and my son LOVES chewing on Sophie's head especially. He finds this toy scattered among his millions of other toys and totes it around the house when he's crawling around. Still can't believe I spent $17 on it, but it was well worth it!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,This teether is exactly what other reviews say.  It is incredible.  My 6 months old took to it right away.  Its the perfect shape to get those little hands around and perfect for gumming on.  It's nice and soft and totally natural.  We love it,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My daughter loves this toy. She chews on it all day and it's nice to know that it is a safe toy..,4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I hesitated to buy this because it was such a high price for a simple toy, but after hearing so many great things, I decided to order for my little guy.  He LOVES it!  It is one of his favorite toys, and was worth every penny!  I will definitely keep it in mind for friends family members who have babies.  It would make a great gift.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This Vulli Sophie is so badly, it has serious smell and drop chips, I'm so disappointed. I cannot give it to my baby, I think it's fake.",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,A really good quality one as what I've expected.. My 4 months nephew loves it very much as well! Good buy as a gift!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My Son (10 mths) loves his Sofie the Giraffe. We bought one in France while visiting relatives for about 8 euros at the grocery store. $[...] seems a little expensive. [...],5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My 7mo son LOVES Sophie!  It has lots of different shapes to chew on and it squeaks!  He's always quite proud of himself when he can make it squeak.  =),5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Sophie gets rave reviews, and I can understand she is a fun object for babies to chew, but unfortunately I have noticed her paint comes off and rubs off easily into babies mouth and on wet paper towels when it needs to be cleaned off.  I was gently washing Sophie with a wet rag because I spilled something on it, and the colors came right off and then I noticed they get on babies mouth as well.  I love the concept, but the toy should be made out of better materials the cost.  Not good quality.",2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I needed to purchase some newborn gifts for about 5x babies of friends and family.  I purchased 5x Sophie the Giraffe Teethers.  The Sophie Giraffe products arrived in two days with my Amazon Prime account.  The packaging was great and products arrived in mint condition.  I gave the gift to each person and they were very thankful.  Some had heard about the product.  One friend already had one Sophie and was thankful to get another.  The gifts were a hit.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,THe teether looks cute but is totally over-priced. My boy liked it at the beginning but a while later it stopped making the sound when you squeeze it and the paint came off on some spots. Maybe the material is safer but we have no way to prove that.,3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,This is the 5th one I buy. It is now my signature gift for all expecting mothers. My kids loved it and I know everyone I have given it to loves it too.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"As a new parent, we read all the reviews first. My son was 5 months and put EVERYTHING in his mouth when I bought Sophie.. I figured Sophie wouldn't be a problem.. After washing the toy, we gave it to him and I expected the drool machine to be happy. That wasn't the case. He wrinkled his face up like it was the worst thing he ever tasted. This lead to more washing of Sophie. The only part that my son could chew on was the ears as it was just too big for his mouth. It's been 2 months and Sophie still gets minimal love.. I'm still looking for a substitute for the knuckles of my index finger.. I think my son will be a cannibal :(",2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"But there's a reason everyone loves Sophie. It was the only toy my baby showed any interest in for about 2 months. It's perfect for teething, easily gripped and for some reason endlessly enjoyable to a newborn/infant.We buy them for our pregnant friends now.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Is it worth it?  With so many inexpensive teethers on the market in all shapes and sizes, why is this one so popular?  Yes, it's trendy.  Yes, the celebrities all have these for their babies.  Yes, it's European.  But is it really worth the price for your baby?That's the question I've been asking myself ever since receiving Vulli Sophie the Giraffe as a gift from a well-meaning (and much-hipper-than-I-am) friend.  My answer is a qualified ""yes.""  Here are the benefits.  This teether is several inches tall, making it larger than many other teethers.  Also, it has a lot of appendages (four legs and a long neck).  These features make it easy for my uncoordinated baby to hold on to this teether.  That's a big benefit.  Also, the shape of the legs and head result in a variety of teething choices.  My baby prefers to grip the teether by the legs and to chew on the giraffe's ears or nose.  I've seen other babies who prefer to chew on the front or back legs.  One baby I know even prefers to chew on the giraffe's rump.  With so many choices, your baby is bound to discover one that she/he likes.  Additionally, the teether makes a squeaky sound when squeezed (think about a traditional dog squeaky toy).  My baby likes this sound (as do my dogs).  Finally, the all-rubber surface of this teether makes it easy to clean.  These are the benefits.Here are the downsides.  The rubber on this teether is a bit stinky and definitely has a taste that my baby isn't thrilled about.  She's willing to put up with it, but I can tell that the taste isn't as pleasant to her as that of some of her other teethers.  Also, this teether doesn't have any rough patches or bumps, and those bumps are soothing to babies with serious teething going on.  Finally, this teether costs double or triple what other teethers cost, and that's a big downside if you're buying this for your own baby.  So, weigh the pros against the cons and make a decision if this teether is right for you.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I always give this gift as a present whenever someone has a baby and it always goes over well.  My daughter introduced me to it when she had her baby.  It is a lovely baby gift.!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Amazon is great!  Bought for the Giraffe and not necessarily to be used as a teether.  Product was excellent quality but the price might have been a little high?I could see where this would be great for babies who are teething,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Purchased SOPHIE for my teething 6 mos old grandson. Although SOPHIE is cute, didn't think she was $18 cute.  Her ""write-ups"" though were extrememly positive and felt the comfort provided to my grandson, during his teething period, would be worth it. Can't say he's enamored by this sweet looking giraffe, however, at times he does nibble her ear.  Biggest disappoint was the loss of SOPHIE'S squeaker. After 2 weeks, she no longer makes a sound.  The squeaker obviously slipped internally and there is no way to repair.  Expected more from an $18 teething toy.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This is the greatest teething aid I've ever seen.  Our baby loves it, and it's 100 percent natural.  The giraffe design catches our little one's eyes, she enjoys the squeaks, and she won't let go of it.  In fact, it's safe to say it's become one of her favorite toys.  If you're looking for a great teether, you can't go wrong with Sophie the Giraffe.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This is the second Sophie I've bought for a grandchild.  There is no beating this most loved friend.  The boys love teething on her and she is easy for them to hold.  When I was first introduced to Sophie my first thought was ""Are you kidding me....it looks like a toy I would have had as a baby.""  Boy, was I wrong!  Sophie Rules!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My 6 month old got Sophie when she was a little over two months old and, quite frankly, wasn't at all interested in her. But by 5 months when the drooling started in earnest and everything went to her mouth, she realized Sophie is wonderful! She loves the squeak toy aspect though it does confuse our poor dog since it sounds like a dog toy. But the squeaky kisses Sophie gives my girl brings laughter and smiles every time. Well worth the price but certainly order this from Amazon as it costs $5-6 more at Babies 'R Us!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Soft and has a squeak.....4 month old just figured out how to make it squeak on purpose. Love it! Thanks,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I bought this for my 6 month old granddaughter and she loves it. It has a soft texture to it and is easy for her to hold.She also likes it to squeak, she looks for it when you squeak it.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,my baby loved this product. so easy for little hands to hold. glad I bought this for her. definitely recommend,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Sophie the girafe is the best toy ever invented!:)  My daughter loves to chew on her even today at fifteen months old.  We could note have gotten thru teething without Sophie.  Everyone who sees Sophie always yells ""SOPHIE WE LOVE HER!"":)  It is also nice knowing that she is not made in China.  One of the only teethers out there unless you go to a super specialty store.  Out only problem is that our Lab still thinks it belonds to him and he tries to ""steal"" Sophie on occassion!:),5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I bought this toy for my daughter and she never really liked it that much. It was OK, but she did not favor it over any of her other toys. She was a late teether, getting her first two teeth at almost a year old, so that may be why. Sophie stopped squeaking after a few months of light use. Although my daughter was not crazy about it, her baby friend picked it up on a play date and loved it. Just like so many other things, this is another thing that I think some babies adore and others could care less about. I found out my child prefers frozen waffles as teethers!",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"We gave Sophie to our kid when he was 4 months and he still loves it. Loves to chew on the giraffe in all possible ways. Probably not his favorite but he nibbles on it quite often whenever he feels like biting on something,",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I've bought 4. No really. Anyone that even looks pregnant is getting one from now on. Just a wise purchase.All the parents rave and the kids seems fixated on Sophie. Wish they had more products alongside it.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,The title says it all... this teething toy is the ONLY toy that works for molars (and anyone who's had a child knows the molars are the WORST!). The legs are just long enough to be chewed on without worrying about baby gagging on them.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Loved the product, is used on a daily basis by the beautiful recipient.  Sad to say that when it was received the box was destroyed, embarassing when giving it as a gift!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Alright, first off didn't realize this was a squeaky toy.  It is high quality but still same construction as a dog toy.  I really wouldn't of gotten it had I known it squeaked, it drives my dog nuts.  I buy a present for my 4 month old that I now got to make sure the dog doesn't get to.  It's not a bad toy but really nothing special and the fact that it is basically a re-purposed dog toy is rather disappointing, no idea how it goes so many good reviews.",2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I gifted this to a mom-to-be so her second child would have her own Sophie just like her first child.  Mom was very happy.Sophie is a great gift for new babies.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My 8 month old son just received Sophie and absolutely loves her! So does my husband and the dog too! More than just a teether, my son loves to shake Sophie around just to hear her squeak! I let him take Sophie to his crib for nap time but had to take her away as he was just having way too much fun playing with her. Get one!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,This is an awesome teether. Slightly expensive but my Son used it for months so it was definitely worth it. He loved it! Very cool teether.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My aunt bought us this for our first girl, and both she and our now 1 year old loved it.  They can chew on the legs, bend them and the neck - and since it is durable but all natural we had no fear of choking or other issues.  This is also very easy to wash off in the sink since it gets chewed on a lot.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,This was recommended to me by a friend. I bought it when my daughter was 3 months old and she loves it! she chews on it wherever we go and it is always with us! she smiles when we squeak it and she can manipulate it very well! we are actually buying a 2nd one to have as a backup in case we lose the first. We highly recommend this to all parents.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"How else can you spend approximately $20 to watch your child gnaw on a silly gummy toy and thoroughly consider it money well spent? I thought it was absolutely ridiculous to spend this much on a kid's chew toy, but after my child found it completely addictive while teething, I bought another one. The only drawback to this toy is that if you wash it too many times, the spots come off and Sophie ends up looking like a freaky albino...",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This toy is very cute to look at and very easy to handle for a baby.  The baby's mother specifically asked for this, so I purchased 2 - one for a baby born and another baby due in March.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My six month old daughter LOVES her Sophie.Yes, it looks and sounds like a dog toy, but it is also made of safe materials and I am sure dog toys are not given the same care.  My daughter does occasionally get a giraffe leg pretty far into her mouth and it makes her gag, but she's not really choking.  Sophie's body gets in the way and it's not like she could swallow it.We actually like how much interest the dog is showing in the toy (thanks to the squeak) because it's given us a great opportunity to make sure the dog understands that whatever the baby has (no matter how exciting it may look/smell/sound) is absolutely NOT hers.  It's worked really well.Sophie is perfect for teething because it has just enough flexibility, it is easy for my daughter to hold, and it is clear it makes her teeth feel better.  I say register for it for a shower or birthday and hope someone buys it for you, so then you don't have to worry about whether or not it is overpriced.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My daughter chewed on it a little, but actually ended up preferring metal teething rings. She liked playing with it more than nibbling on it.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I bought this for my teething 6mo old, all the reviews were great. However, I didn't realize that it squeaks. If you don't mind listening to it ALL the time, then it would probably be great to teeth. I didn't even let her see it, so I have no idea if she would have liked it. It did smell like a plastic dog toy and like I said, IT SQUEAKS! I have no idea why this toy would cost so much, not worth it, in my opinion. I returned it right away. I guess I'll stick to the gel and wood teethers for my little one.l",2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My 6 month old loved it and reached for sophie the moment she saw it and promptly started chewing on it so vulli  must have gotten something right about the teether. Her 3 year old twin cousins were playing n squeaking it as well...so all in all a good purchase - both for teething n play.,4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Bought this when my son was about 8 months, now at 21 months he plays with every once in a while. He likes to hit it with things to make it squeak but that's about it. It did have a strong rubber smell and still does. Also if you make the same mistake as me and wash it and get water in it, try putting it in your car on a hot day so water evaporates ;)",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My 4.5 months little daughter love this teether very much and like to bytes it a lot at her age now.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"cute teether. easy to clean. Seems like every mom has one now! My son likes it, doesn't have to have it.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,We just got our adorable Sophie this week and my 4 & 1/2 month old daughter loves it. I'm sure there are other great teethers out there but Sophie is easy for chubby hands to grab and she has lots of long or nubby bits to chew on - whatever baby is in the mood for.  Our daughter smiles every time she sees her Sophie and is content to gnaw on her when she needs to.  I love that Sophie is made from rubber trees and non-toxic food grade paint. Love her!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Twice I found my baby sticking the legs in her mouth and into the back of her throat and choking/gagging.  She was not able or could not figure out to pull it back out (of course, she is a baby)  threw this product away!  If I was not watching her who knows what would have happened. Looked this up online and found this to be a common problem and I believe it had been removed from some stores",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"It was absolutely amazing, we didn't even put the Sophie teether on our registry and we got 4 of them from friends. There's a reason why, kids love this thing. Our 6 month old loves chewing on this thing whether it's on the couch, in the car or in his crib! The squeaky sound is an added bonus because it gives his feedback when he presses on the toy!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My 6 month old's favorite toy by far. I love that she is non toxic, no BPA or other bad chemicals. She has so many places to chew and she is the perfect size for my little one's hands. A must have!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My 4 months old has been chewing happily on Sophie for a month now. We take her everywhere. Soft, easy to hold and my son LOVES to chew,suck,hold this giraffe. WELL WORTH the price!!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I thought it was made from a special material, but the product is very simple, a mere plastic that can be found everywhere. it is too expensive.",2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My 5-mos old son took to this immediately. The shape of the neck makes it easy to hold and the shape of the legs allows him to stick the feet toward the backs of his gums for sucking and chewing, easing discomfort from teething. (Only the Melissa and Doug bugs container seems to offer similar toys that reach back there with ease. Few toys have that extension and texture.) Especially in his car seat, he often falls asleep with the tip of a leg in his mouth.I was surprised that the toy is so soft and hollow; I'd expected a foam and not the ""dog toy"" texture.  And sure enough, my dog LOVES this giraffe!  We stepped out of the room to change a diaper and the dog, who normally shadows us, was nowhere to be seen.  Suddenly ""squeak squeak squeak"" could be heard from across the house.  Our darling mutt schemed to wait til we left to grab the giraffe and race off with his prize.  LOL... every chance he gets!  I suppose that's a downside, but we just clean it with soap and hot water or stick it in the dishwasher and we're good to go.  Anyway, we can legitimately say that the WHOLE family loves this toy!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I received this as a gift for my second child. It is the best teether toy. She would suck and teeth on it for hours. I was so impressed with the product that I purchased a couple of other Vulli teethers in other styles. Those however, did not have the same impact as Sophie the giraffe and were ignored. Hands down, Sophie is it.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Sophie is great. I had my doubts about spending this much money for a &#34;chew toy&#34; but it was well worth it. We've had it for almost 2 years now and it still looks great and my 2 year old son still plays with it.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My niece is 9 months old and loves her giraffe. It is great because it easy for her to grasp and the long neck allows her to keep her hands naturally in front of her while chewing it. The colors on the giraffe have not faded. This little toy stands up to major wear and tear. Delightful toy for a little one!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Best toy/teether EVERWe're in love with sophie, this definitely is a must have for moms and babies everywhere :)",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My son loves this toy, and has from the beginning!  We received it as a gift when he was 2 months old.  At that age, he loved looking at the contrast of the spots and feeling the funny shape of the toy.  As he got a little older, he loved the squeaker, especially when he discovered that he could do it himself.  Now that he is teething he mouths it all day.  I think the hard rubber and shape of the features offer many different surfaces to soothe his sore gums.I like that fact that it is not made of cheap plastic.  I feel more confident that this toy is safe for my son.I would definitely recommend Sophie!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This is a fake Sophie. I will not buy it from amazon.  The fake one has raised serial number on leg while real one has serial number inscribed. Also differences in size, color, smell and feel of rubber. This one is a knock-off. Feel deceived that the fakes are being sold here.",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This is my grand daughters favorite toy! it's great to hold and she loves to chew on it. I also ordered her the Sophie the Giraffe first book, but never received it.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I didn't really do much research on this product. A close friend, who is also a FT nanny, recommended this product. ""You HAVE HAVE HAVE to get this!!!!!"" I thought it was a pretty expensive teething toy. But I bought it nonetheless because my 8 month old son hasn't been too fond of cold teething rings and similar items.I did NOT know it was also a squeaky toy!!! It's not that bad though.It's easy to rinse off. It's easy to find. I just wish it wasn't such a pricey item.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I thought it was really good toy and bought it. Cheap tires, horrible chemical smell. Such toys in China cost less than $1. Do not poison your children this crap.",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Well we've had out Sophie out of the package about 45 minutes and I have already had to yell at our dogs about seven times. I know this isnt going to end well for Sophie. See, Sophie has a squeaker, which I was unaware of. I just bought my dogs a fancy $20 chew toy!  Once my son drops her, shes a goner.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This is the first review I've written for anything, but we love Sophie so much I wanted to share our delight. My four month old grasped her right out of the package. Even with not much hand control, she can hold Sophie and chew on her with great satisfaction! The texture seems to bring relief to her sore gums and there are many choices for chewing (legs, nose, ears). Even my 6 and 10 year olds love Sophie. They make her dance and squeak for their baby sister. This is our third baby. Rather then buying a million little toys, we are buying a few, more expensive, but quality toys and teethers. Sophie is worth the money.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,He loves this giraffe! He will extend his arm and smack it on the ground back and forth. He likes to put it under his knee and squeak it when he is sitting in his bouncer. This is his buddy when we travel and he will kick it in his car seat.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,This toy is awesome. My 3 1/2 year old can hold it easily and stick Sophie in the mouth! Can't ask for more than that.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My daughter really loved Sophie at 4 months and during teething time.  She also enjoys the other products made by this vendor.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,This is a must have for the modern teething baby loll it's a lot cheaper on amazon I love it baby loves it what eel is ther to say,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"...I just saw other baby's happily mawing it everywhere we went.I'd come across Sophie during my pre-baby hunt for usable items and this rated well, but I wasn't 100% convinced.Then I noticed babies happily gnawing on it many places we went and decided to order one.Once I had it, a gal in my parenting support group mentioned it was on Oprah, etc.That didn't matter to me at all because my little guy loves mashing his gums of the giraffe's feet and face.I do see the paint slowly wearing away, but it's food grade dye, so I'm not worried about it. I don't think my little one cares about the visual appeal of the giraffe, except for the creepy black eyes.Those eyes are on nearly ALL his toys and he loves staring at them.Overall, if your baby loves to chew and maw this is a good teether.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"It is a very simple toy. When I open the box, it just depressed me a lot. Why spend 22$ buying this little plastic toy?",2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"After reading endless reviews on this thing, I finally decided to dish out the money for this toy. Once I got it in the mail, I was already a little disappointed - it looks just like a rubber dog toy you buy from petsmart, squeaks like one too. I still wanted to try it out because I was desperate to find something to help alleviate my son's teething pain, but the dog was more interested than he was. It didn't seem to help him. I just wanted to share this for the moms on here who are willing to buy anything to help with their baby's teething pain. This isn't the toy. My son likes a cold pacifier, the silicone raspberry teether (costs only $4) or even the tip of his baby spoons better than this thing. It certainly shouldn't be amazon's #1 baby item.",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Baby has not interest in this teething toy. Not sure why. Wasted money on this one. Too bad. Don't emerse in water though cuz' water will get stuck inside. Keep it away from bathtub.,1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I am a foster parent and have three babies use this Teether.  It is a great product.  The babies love it.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I didn't get Sophie for my first baby because I couldn't justify spending close to $20 on a teething toy. I broke down and bought it for my second baby and I'm so glad I did!  He just loves it!!  He plays with it more than his other pricier toys and it seems to soothe his sore gums. His face lights up when he sees Sophie. Even my two year old wants to play with her!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"What a great toy!  My 7 mo old just loves it!  He's teething right now and he just loves to gnaw on Sophie.  It's nice to have a toy that I know isn't exposing him to all sorts of toxic chemicals when he puts it in his mouth.  We also like the fact that you can squeeze any part of Sophie and she will squeak, you don't have to squeeze in one specific spot.  Overall a fantastic toy.  I will be giving it as a gift to expectant parents for years to come!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I bought Sophie because of all the hype, and after buying the cheaper Vanilla Vulli teething rings. My baby loves those. I thought Sophie would be like that, only larger. It's not at all like that. It's basically a very overpriced dog toy. My baby plays with it sometimes, but certainly doesn't seem to prefer it over her other, much cheaper, teethers. I could have bought four of those for the cost of this one. My fault for being swayed by hype.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I bought this teether for my daughter about a year ago.  It has become her favorite teether.  She seems to select which leg or ear to chew on based on which tooth is bugging her.  My favorite feature is the cleanablility.  We all know how frequently toys end up on the floors of restaurants, stores, etc.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My daughter enjoyed this toy SO MUCH. Not only for teething help but also for entertainment. The quality is wonderful and I believe we will pass this down to the next one. :),5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,my son is 7 months old and teething and he loves this teether. Its very soft and has good places for him to hold onto it and chew without losing it. Very happy I purchased it :),4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My child has not really been that entertained by this.  Everyone told me, you have to get Sophie!  But I think it is just an overpriced squeaky toy that my child has mostly ignored.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My son is 7 months old and Sophie goes EVERYWHERE with us!  She stays in his carseat when we're home just to make sure that she's in the car with us when we leave.  My son laughs and laughs every time she squeaks.  I highly recommend her!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"sophie is a baby's best friend.  cute, squeaky and fun to chew and drool on...sophie should definitely be on your ""to  buy"" list.  great gift too!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My little niece loves this thing, she is still extremely young so she can't quite gnaw on it, but she loves to rub the ears and feet on her gums.The squeak it makes it cute too, though you might want to show the baby the noise before hand, it startled my niece a bit.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My son loves Sophie. When he hears her squeak, he gets excited and looks for her. And she's always got a smile on her face! She's easy to clean. However, if she gets a little too wet, she looses her squeak for a few days. I was really bumped to hear the garbled squeak but she luckily came back after a few days. At first I was hesitant to buy buy her due to the price but so happy I did. She is loved in our home! :)",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Our girl loves her Sophie. We actually lost her first one, and she was always trying to steal her cousin's Sophie!We re-ordered one for her and now all is right with the world once again.It is super cute when she crawls with it because it squeaks.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I ordered this for my Son. He chews on her all day. Sophie is easy to clean and my son  never gets tires of her.,4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My son at 5 months already has his two bottom teeth and is trying to put everything in his mouth.  If he can't reach where he wants to chew he gets sorta fussy but Sophie has so many teething options that he will chew on it for quite some time without throwing it down.  The legs are perfect for farther back in his mouth and I am not worried about parts coming off. Great product!!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Like every other parent out there that has talked to me about this toy, for whatever reason babies gravitate towards it.  My son recently started teething and with the multiple teething aids available this is his go to.  No idea why.  The squeaking is fun too.  It makes him laugh.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I bought this for my 6 month old based on all the positive reviews, but was dubious as he did not really enjoy any other teething rings we had bought himSophie arrived promptly and was well packaged, with no damage to any packaging or the toy. We just gave the toy a quick wash (for safety's sake) and handed it over. My wee boy loved it and it went straight into his mouth. The shape is ideal for small hands, it is easily manipulated, and there is not a surface that cannot fit into a mouth.Sophie washes easily so can be kept clean of food and the general mess that babies toys can get into. One quick wash and it is good to go. This has fast become our wee boys favourite toy and is definitely worth the money.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This is the cheapest I've seen it anywhere and with the free Prime shipping it was even better!  My five month old daughter loves her Sophie.  Other than a freezable gel ring we bought for a couple of bucks, it's the only teething toy we will need to buy.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,One of the best teething toys ever. My daughter has love this and chewed on it for teething since she was about 3 mos old due to the size and shape it's easy for her to hold and control. I know buy them as baby shower gifts because get are so great.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"After all the hype I have heard about how this giraffe is the best teething toy and how much babies love it, I decided to try it for my four-month old son.  I was wary of spending so much on a baby toy, however, so I used a coupon and a gift card to purchase it.  Thank goodness I didn't spend $17 on this!  It is kind of cute, but I was immediately disappointed by the flimsy rubber and almost ""dog toy"" quality of the toy.  Then I squeezed the darn thing and it let out the loudest squeak!  Not impressed.  My son does kind of like to chew on it, but the squeak scares him!  My husband squeezed it to try to entertain him the other day, and the baby started crying! Some kids might enjoy the sound, but I don't think this is going to be one my child's favorite toys.Update (August 29, 2011):  I take back what I said about Sophie.  My son is now 9 months old, and he has grown quite fond of Sophie.  He actually likes the squeak now, and he loves to chew on her.  Still not sure if she is worth $17, but I am glad I bought her!  I'm changing my rating from 2 stars to 4.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Baby girl loves her new friend and is able to hold on to it with a tight grip.  A little more than you would pay for for a regular teether, but quite worth the money!  She loves Sophie!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Being a child photographer, I saw lots of kids with this giraffe and parents would always say ""I don't know why but he/she LOVES this thing, we have to have it everywhere with us"" so when I had my own baby, I thought I MUST have this thing. I was so excited to open it and give it to my almost 4 month old son. And then....I realized, I love Sophie much more than he does right now! She is very lightweight and easy for him to hold but with his hand/eye coordination not being so great yet, he can't get it into his mouth as easily as he'd like, leading to lots of eye pokes. I've determined that this is something he can only have while highly supervised for now! I expect his love for Sophie will grow as he does though.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This was the best thing to have when my daughter was teething.  When we received it as a gift, I had never heard of it.  The paint comes off as the child chews on it, but it is edible safe paint.  It is very durable and perfect for children's little hands.  We passed our daughter's on to a cousin after she was finished with it and it is still going strong!  Now I just purchased this as a gift for a new mom.  Highly recommend!!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Sophie is very cute and well-made. Good Quality.  I was very excited when I got it and couldn't wait to give it to my baby boy, who is 8 months old.  Supprisely he is not interested in it at all.  He kep pushing it away.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I heard about Sophie in a Stroller Strides class when my son was two months old.  I immediately purchased her and it was by far my son's favorite teether.  Ten months later Sophie is still fully intact and my son's favorite teether.  To keep her squeeker working, you have to remember not to get water in it when washing her! We have been successful thus far!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I have no idea what the fascination is with the Sophie but since it works like a charm, I'll take it. It seems to be the ideal size to grip and helps so much during the teething phase. Definitely worth the money.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,We are very pleased with this purchase!  We have purchased 2 Sophies (1 for each child) and both loved to chew and play with the toy.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"We got this toy when our baby was 3.5 months old--ALL the little ones in our Brooklyn neighborhood have this thing, so I figured there was good reason for it.  Indeed.  It's dimensions make it easy to grasp--my baby's little fingers fit nicely around the head, neck, or any of the legs. The long neck of the giraffe make it so that when she's holding it at her waist with her hands, it reaches all the way up to her mouth.  She loves chewing on all the knobs around the head and on the hooves.  She is attracted to the simple face with it's dark eye dots and loves to make it squeak.  This is a fantastic toy, no wonder it's been around for so many decades!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I love this teether! It's pricey but worth it. My four month old loves it and gets excited when he sees it. It's the perfect size for his little hands. Sophie will definitely be my go to baby shower gift from now on!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I have bought Sophie for both my kids as well as friends and family too. My kdis LOVED Sophie. It is the perfect size for baby to hold and they would spend forever slobbering all over Sophie when they were teething. They never took to other teething toys. I thought the price was crazy when I first saw it for a teether but after all the reviews had to give it a shot and was well worth the money!!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"my son loves sophie.  he smiles as soon as he hears it squeaking.  he was able to hold it and chew on it beginning at four months, and sophie has been wonderful for teething.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My Baby girl loves slobbery all over it, and the point that its made out of food coloring makes me feel all the better about letting  my lil one chomp all over it. Very easy to clean just an overall nice teething toy for my baby girl.Must have for every lil tot teething...",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,This teether is ADORABLE and my 4 month old loves it but be warned that it is much like a dog toy with a squeaker.  If you have a dog that likes squeaker toys you may want to think twice before purchasing this as the dog will likely want to make it his own.,3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"It's really terrible. When my 4 months daughter started to chew it,I just found that the rubber was peeling off.....So scary. I returned it to AMAZON right away.",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I thought it would sound,but the sound hole of the teether did not work, when I got the teether.Why do my Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether not a voice!",2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Our 6-week-old loves Sophie! I started letting her chew on Sophie very early so she'd be used to the taste, smell, etc. before she started teething. She LOVES to chew on her face! She knows the sound of the squeak now and will look for it when she hears it.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I tried to offer this to my son several times when he was a few months old and he was very disinterested. Eventually when he was about 5 months old he suddenly became interested. He likes it but it's not his favorite by any means. These teething rings from Vulli win hands down over sophie-http://www.amazon.com/Vulli-Vanilla-Flavored-Teethe-Colors/dp/B001N45DM2/ref=sr_1_2?s=baby-products&ie=UTF8&qid=1360729347&sr=1-2&keywords=vulli and they are ADORABLE,4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Well, she's kind of in love with Sophie a little.  She gets annoyed when she can't quite get Sophie into her mouth the way she wants.The dogs...really, really want Sophie in a bad, bad way so I'm almost certain that eventually, they'll end up eating this seventeen dollar teething toy.  :)",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My LO loves this toy. It helps with teething and is entertaining. The only down side to the product is trying to clean between the horns and and ears. You have to really get in there because gunk accumulates.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I swore I would never buy this teether, as I thought it was just over-priced and over-hyped.  But, when our daughter reached the age where she wanted to put anything-and-everything in her mouth, I caved and thought we'd give it a whirl because those legs & ears looked like they were the perfect size for her continuous gumming.Turns out, I was correct: this giraffe is basically just a glorified squeak-toy; even has that dog-toy smell! With that said, my daughter still likes it.  She's not even teething age yet, she just likes gumming it--so we're pretty sure she'll just love it even more once she's teething.  If she continues at the rate she's going, we'll probably get our money's worth with this teether.  In the end, I'm pretty sure it's a good investment!",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"We bought this teether for our 4th month old son.  We had searched high and low for a BPA free teether that was small enough for our young teether.  Well, Sophie the Giraffe was the answer.  Our son loves Sophie.  And with her 100% all natural including the food paint she is colored with we have nothing to worry about.  The cost is worth it, she is the only teether your child will ever need!!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I debated over buying this product for a long time. My friend had one for her son and I read so many reviews and couldn't believe what people were saying about Sophie and I was having a hard time justifying spending $20 on something my son may not like. Well after a terrible few days of teething I broke down and bought Sophie, my husband thought I was crazy. Well let me tell you MY SON LOVES HER. He is amazed by her and he plays and chews on her all the time. Every review is right, it is worth the money and your child will love her.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My daughter had a Sophie in the mid 70's...though it was a bit smaller.  It didn't survive over all these years so I was delighted to find one on Amazon.  It is still a huge success both for it's teething qualities but also as an entertainment with its squeaky ""voice"".  I am ordering another one for my great great grandniece today.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,It's a good one.My baby likes it very much.It's so good!It makes my baby not crying.I will buy it soon,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I was skeptical when my wife said that she had ordered a [...] toy for our son, but he has had his Sophie for a couple of months now, and absolutely loves it.  One of the best things about it is the skinny neck and legs.  That makes it much easier for little hands to grab and hold on to.  It is great to put in his carseat because it is one of the toys that he doesn't easily drop, which makes car rides that much more fun.  The heavy rubber is a nice change of pace from the soft stuffed toys and the hard plastic toys too.  I highly recommend it.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,This is a great teether and toy! Every time our daughter sees it she smiles and reaches for it. It can be washed in the dishwasher to keep it sanitized. I can only say get it!! It will be a great item for your child.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My grandson dragged this around until he started to walk.  Since then, he keeps it under his arm wherevr he goes.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I bought this for my grandson on a recommendation by a young mother and my grandson loves it.  It's soft and squeaks easily and is easy to hold onto.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My daughter likes it but one time I did notice the white rubbing off when it was wet but I have not seen it rub off anymore,3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My baby boy is 5 months old and seems to really like Sophie.  She is chewable almost everywhere and he will switch it up. She helps his gums feel better.  I recommend this toy.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I actually purchased Sophie elsewhere but i was skeptical when i saw it and the price tag attached to it. I thought it was an over priced toy that parents were being suckered into buying. But i ended up buying it anyways and i'm glad i did. My 8 month old daughter loves Sophie so much! She loves the texture of the rubber and it squeaks with minimal pressure to any part of the giraffe. I would buy this again in a heartbeat.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Never thought I'd see my son French kissing a giraffe, let alone French kissing a French giraffe, but he adores her so. I swear Sophie is like crack for 4 month olds, he looks at her and gets this possessed look in his eyes, reaches out, grabs her with his little chubby hands around her legs, and stuffs her nose into his mouth, where he proceeds with a veritable orgy of chewing. The natural rubber is a little squeaky on his gums when he bites, and when he squeezes her body, she squeaks, which delights him. We've gotten more giggles by dancing Sophie's feet on his tummy while squeaking her. He's teething furiously right now, and Sophie makes it a little more fun. The one we got had no issues with running paint or fragile rubber, it is tough, durable, and he's slobbered all over the thing without paint coming off, so I think we're good, but remember that a lot of these come from different sellers, even if Amazon is shipping them prime.Sophie's been around for 50 years for a reason...ETA: After a couple months of use, some of the paint is starting to wear off Sophie's ears, and there are a few tiny cracks in the surface of the paint, but with the abuse she gets from my kids, this seems well within the acceptable range for me. My special needs 7 year old tends to swipe her whenever she can, and uses her to bounce against her iPad she uses for communication, which is good, because it doesn't trigger the iPad's screen and is not likely to hurt it. The baby loves to gnaw on every part of the giraffe, and popped 2 teeth before 5 months old.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Very disappointed upon arrival, it resembles a $20.00 dog toy. Paint is already pealing off. Save money and buy a real one.",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My girl loves this toy. She chews on it a lot, making a funny squeeky sound with her yet teethless gums. I like that the toy is very light and bends easily, and made of natural materials. It's the first toy my baby was able to sqeeze and bend to make a sound.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My husband gave me a strange look when I announced that I bought an almost $20 squeak toy, but after having this for six (6) months he now understands that it was worth it!The product description of this toy seems a little whimsical when it describes how it is a toy for all the senses; however, I am 100% sold.  Besides the smell (it doesn't really seem to have a scent), I would argue that this one toy does entice my baby's sense of sight, touch, taste, and hearing.Summary of the PROS:- Color, I like that this toy is not obnoxiously bright blue, pink, green, yellow and orange!  Every other toy is an eyesore.- The squeak is slightly annoying (like any squeak toy) but it really does make my baby smile when we are out and he gets fussy- The rubber is soft enough that my baby can chew on it without injuring himself and not too soft to puncture (the chewing sound does make a rubbing rubber sound that makes me cringe, but baby loves it).- The &#34;small&#34; parts, I like that the legs, neck and head are small enough for my baby to grab and chew on without being too small.CONS:- Slightly expensive, but worth it in my opinion.- Another mom friend said that the squeak sounds similar to that of her dog's toys so the dog likes to play with this too.  Having two (2) dogs that love squeak toys I am amazed that my dogs have not touched this toy.- I wish there were real instructions (not just vague information on the box) concerning cleaning.  If the squeaker gets wet it sounds like Sophie has a serious cold for a few days until it dries.  Along with this I am also potentially concerned about mold or anything growing inside - no worries yet but I can see how this may occur.It may sound strange that all of my PROS seemed to have CONS attached, but I would like to be clear - I would buy this product again and I would highly recommend this product to anyone with an infant.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I sometimes think that there is an addictive substance hidden within our Sophie. Man, my toddler loves NOTHING more then this little creation. I initially scoffed at the price of this item and held out on buying it- until I saw my little guy try to steal it from a friend. The next day he got his own Sophie, and I became a believer. The price of this toy far outweighed the possible embarassment of him getting caught red handed again :) WORTH EVERY PENNY!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"great gift for expectant mother or baby teeting. very cute and tried and true. i recommend sophie the giraffe teether,",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My daughter was given this as a gift, and being my first child, I had never heard of ""Sophie"" before.  I was impressed with the story that comes along with it (with respect to the natural rubber and safe paint) but was really surprised with how much my little girl absolutely loves it!!  As soon as she started gripping objects, this one became her favorite as it is easy to hang onto.  She is just starting to teethe, and chews on either the legs or head constantly.  I would absolutely recommend this as a gift for your child or for any baby shower gift.  Thanks Tammy!! :)",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Best teether ever! It's my daughter's favorite and easy for her little hands to grasp and hold with its skinny neck and legs. She grabs it and goes to town! :),5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I got this for my daughter when she was 3 months old. She took to it immediately. It's really easy to grip for her since both the neck and the legs are skinny enough for her little hands. It's easy to clean and actually really cute. My daughter is now 7 months and has got her first two teeth, and she still absolutely loves chewing on Sophie. Highly recommend this toy!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I purchased this for my at the time 6 month old for Christmas. I had seen it previously and I didn't really ""get it"". It looked like an over priced dog toy to me. The reviews are consistently excellent though so I decided to try it anyway. I'm do glad we ordered it. My little guy favors it the most out of all of his teethers and insists that it goes everywhere with us. I'm thinking about buying a second one for just in case! Definetly worth adding to your little teethers collection!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Sophie is so cute, and comes just as seen! I can't wait to see how my son reacts to her when he is born. She is very popular, and would buy for a gift any day!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Don't really think this needs a review because everyone has heard all about Sophie. But it is a great product. Made well and this kids (and dogs) love her! Great for boys and girls and makes a perfect baby shower gift for all your friends!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"So much more than a teether. It helps my daughter learn to grab and develop hand-to-mouth coordination; and the squeak factor is a great distractor if she's feeling a little cranky. As a teether, the giraffe is perfect. She can get at it from all different angles, and just chew away. The best part is that I don't worry about what she's chewing on, since the giraffe has no harmful ""ingredients"". If I could give the giraffe ten stars, I would.Thank you to my sister-in-law for this amazing gift. And thank you to Vulli for making it!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I tried to fight the urge to buy it and not get sucked into the pressure of everyone else buying a $20 rubber toy.  But my baby was teething so badly I was desperate.  I don't know what this thing is made of but it works.  He will chomp on this for a long time.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"At first I was very hesitant to buy this teether. I was thinking the cost was pretty high for just a teether and I was worried it would be too big. However, when i opened the package I knew it would be perfect. She is very soft and is a great material for babies. My son is three months old and teething so I had to get something for him to be able to hold himself. Sophie is great. She is easy for him to hold and he loves to chew on her legs and ears. He also loves to hold on to her and he enjoys that she squeaks(he giggles). I think the item is a very good product for any age and I highly recommend it. The only thing I would be careful of is water getting in it. I hold my finger over the hole so the squeaker wont get ruined.Great product!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I don't understand what all the rave about this toy is.bought it for my son and he could not be LESS interested than he is.It tastes kind of rubbery and the squeak is loud and startles him (not to mention its the same exact squeak that dog toys have, so my dog [who's name is also Sophie] thinks its hers)The colors are not as vibrant as the ones on his other toys so he overlooks this when he's got a pile to choose from.",2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My son has had his Sophie since he was 4 months old and he absolutely loves it! All of the reviews about the choking hazard are silly because your child should never be left alone with any toy... This is one of my son's favorite toys and everything about it is wonderful. Its very easy to clean and we take it with us everywhere we go.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My 7 1/2 month old grandbaby was sittng up teething on her BELOVED Sophie. She fell forward, as she does constantly, on her tummy. Usually, this just means more playing and crawling! She was kicking her feet, as usual, facing away from me and I thought her body movement looked strange. I grabbed her up and Sophie's right front leg was jammed down  her throat and had COMPLETELY blocked her breathing!!! As soon as I removed it, she was gasping for air and thankfully began to scream. Sophie is her FAVORITE toy and ours until now! Children should not be unattended with Sopie!",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"When my daughter first asked for this giraffe for her baby girl, I thought she was out of her mind.  Now I'm a huge fan!  Sophie is made in France (not scary China), and so she can teethe to her heart's content.  Plus Sophie is cute and different---but not unique:  everyone seems to have one!  My granddaughter loves to play with her, and Sophie's an especially good distraction in the stroller and carseat.Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether, Brown/ White",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I don't understand the fuss with these tethers. We went through 3 just to give it the benefit of the doubt. The paint came off easily on all of them, you can't wash them as water gets inside so it gets ruined. I say it's a waste of money. Too expensive.",2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I purchased this as a gift for a shower.  My friend loved it and looks forward to using it.  It shipped fast too.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My baby loves it and me too.  It makes noise when press it, it is not too big and not too small, easy to grab for a baby and very good quality.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My son is 23 weeks. He loves to stick everything in his mouth. Tried giving him just a normal teether and he doesn't care for them. This was giving to us as a gift. From the second i squeeked it he loved it. I like to give it to him when I'm trying to change his diaper distracts him. When I first saw it I was like ok cute but.what's the big deal. Now I'm glad I have it.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,It is just what I was looking for.  Very smooth as well and nothing pointed to hurt our upcoming bundle of joy.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My 3 month old  holds it good and soft enough to get to her mouth for teething and she loves it,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Bought this for a gift.  I'm sure she'll love it as much as I do, and hope her baby loves it even more.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,The new Mom was very happy with this unique teether.I was happy it was exactly as described and arrived on schedule.Merci!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Age recommendation for this is 0 and up, but we didn't buy one for our little one until she was 7 months.We gave it to her and her eyes lit up! She held it, and instantly started teething with it. Eventually she got it to squeak and it made her smile.Sophie the giraffe is really adorable - we it with us while out and several people commented on how cute the giraffe is.Be forewarned though, if you have dogs, they take a big interest in this! The squeaker sounds very similar to dog toys.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I can't believe how much is being charged for this silly thing. If you're wondering what the big deal is about this giraffe, I'll tell you- it's nothing.It's an over priced trend.It's no different than a squeaky dog toy.If you get water in the squeaky hole you can expect mold to grow. Lame.",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My baby enjoys this toy but the LOUD squeak has woken him up when he squirms around in his crib during naps. ALso, the dishwasher leaves strange dark bruises on it. Not our top favorite--the vulli vanilla teething rings are better.",2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I bought this for my new grandson. he isn't quite old enough to hold it, much less chomp on it. I know he will love it.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I love this little giraffe teether and plan to give it as a baby gift with the two accompanying books.  Unfortunately the shipping  package was not approriate  (soft) and the item box got damaged.  Not too happy about that, since this is for a gift.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Got this for my great niece.  She now ha one at her home as well as her grandparents.  Everyone likes this,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,It's easy to hold by little fingers n gives sound when she presses it. She loves it very much and smile every time she sees Sophie.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This teether is very cute, good quality. However my son still prefers my car keys than this. It's very unfortunate, coz I love it!",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I don't know why, but my son loves it. Don't let the price scare you, this thing has been worth every penny. For sure it's one of his favorite toys!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My little guy likes Sophie but he definitely could have lived without it.  Personally I wouldn't have bought it if I didn't have a coupon but since I did I figured I'd give it a shot.  He doesn't use it as a teether so much as he likes to just squeak her.,3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"He smiles at the giraffe and open his arms to welcome it every time i give it to him. It's a very good chewing toy for babies who are teething. Easy to grab with these tiny hands. Many different parts can be chewed on, head, horn, foot, even the neck and butt. I guess it's fun for the babies to think and choose which part to chew everyday. I bought two of these so he can take one to daycare also. Would recommend to friends.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My first two grandchildren loved their Sophie so I had to buy one for my new grandson.  Sophie is easy for little hands to hold and they loved to chew on her.  Great for teething.  Highly recommend.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I wanted to love this product and was excited to buy it when I became pregnant but am now hesitant to let my baby use it after reading about the recall in Europe. Apparently, as I understand it, their toxin standards of measurement are lower than ours so they have not been recalled here (apparently we are OK with low levels of nitrates in the toys our children put in their mouths, but Europeans are not...hmmm)...Be that as it may, toxins registering even CLOSE to a dangerous level made me nervous about using. After digging around online I did discover that the company claims to have changed the product after a certain date and lists manufacturing codes so you can check yours (those listed were made after a certain date and are said to be safer). Sadly mine was not made after the &#34;improved&#34; date but I could not return it because there was no formal recall in our country. I considered returning it and hunting for one with an approved manufacturing date but man that was just too much work. Bummed but not ready to take a risk with my baby.",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I can't make a negative review on this, as my son just didn't take to this.  I was trying to make this my solution to a pacifier, but he just didn't care about it.  My dogs, however, seemed to think it was theirs, because of the squeaking, something I didn't think about before purchasing.  So, just a bit of advice, if you have dogs that like squeaky toys, just be careful!",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Had I known about Sophie before now I would only have ever bought my girls one teether instead of all the other little ones out there.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This toy has grown on me as my daughter has now had it for about 6 months. It is great for when they are tiny. My 10 week old baby could hold this light toy on her own and make it squeak. She now gnaws on it to sooth her gums. I think it's a soothing toy to play with for kids who are not binky or thumb suckers. I love when I hear her squeaking it, it's almost her way of saying, ""Hello, I'm here."" Very cute. I have since given several Sophie's as baby shower gifts.One thing to note, this is not a hard plastic toy, it is soft and squishy and squeaks like a dog toy.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Had to give it away without a chew. Good quality but no baby of mine wanted to put it anywhere near his or her mouth. Never quite recovered from bing submerged in water as well.,2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My daughter began teething at 3 months and did not have her first tooth pop until 7 months.  It was definately uncomfortable and painful for her.  We tried numerous teething toys but this was by far her favorite!  She loves to chew on the legs which relieves her pain.  She still plays with it today, even though she's past her teething.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"We love Sophie. She's a fun, squishy toy that's great for teething. All of the cool kids have this toy so naturally, we had to have one too.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"We bought a number of different teethers for my daughter, and as all the previous reviews promised, she LOVED Sophie the best.  Worth every penny!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Best $20 we have spent in a while.  Worth it for your teething child.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My daughter received Sophie as a gift and immediately took to it. She loves chewing on the feet and the horns. She began playing with it at about 3 months and still gets lots of use out of it at 6 months with almost no apparent wear to the toy. It's expensive, but probably rates as her favorite toy and has brought her gums lots of relief. Buy this toy and be a hero!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My 5 month old daughter, for all the great reviews...did not like it! So its all subjective to the baby's...likes...and dislikesShe actually prefers chewing on her bibs and so as long as shes happy, I'm very happy! She likes the squeeze toy noise it makes...but that only captures her attention briefly....but really, that's not why I bought this and spent this money for.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My son has been enjoying Sophie for about 3 months now.  He is currently 6 months old and this is by far one of his favorite toys.  This toy is very easy for him to grab with those little fingers and he loves chewing on legs, ear, horns and mouth.  He also loves the squeak, I can always get a smile out of him by bringing Sophie to his attention.  Sophie is also very easy to clean if dropped, which, lets face it, happens quite often at this age!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I also wondered why I would spend [...] for what some people were calling a ""dog toy"".  I'm glad I did though - he really does love munching on the legs, ears & face of Sophie more then any other teething toy he has.  Sophie is soft & fits easily in his mouth & easy to grip...And it's Easy To Clean!",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My four month old loves Sophie! As the description mentions, it captures the attention of her senses, including hearing and smell. She also loves looking at Sophie's spots. The toy cleans easily and she almost likes it *too* much -- she gets upset when she can't get the little hooves in her mouth fast enough!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My 4 month old would not take a pacifier or any other teether. She only wanted her giraffe. It reminds me of a dog's chew toy but my daughter loves it and that makes me happy. Worth every penny.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I liked that Sophie was 100% natural rubber and safe for my twins to chew.  They did not, however, favor it over other toys to chew and therefore it was not worth the price.  I did like the smell, though; it reminded me of toys when I was a kid.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"When my sister-in-law told me she spent $20 on a teething toy, I thought she was crazy. Then it became my son's favorite toy. There is just something about it--it's squishy, squeaky, and cute. It has relieved his teething better than anything else, and he loves to play with it when it's not in his mouth.  Worth every penny!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My baby started teething early, so this was absolutely perfect for her.  She didn't have great aim to get things in her mouth, so the length and the softness was perfect.  Every time she sees this toy she gets excited, it's one of her favorites.  It's easy to keep clean.  Worth every penny.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I just received Sophie. I am pretty sure that this is a used and/or returned product, which was re-sold to me. The packaging is not sealed, and appears damaged. The actual toy has some of the paint missing.  A store could not sell this product in this condition. My assistant, without promoting noticed it too when I handed it to her. Amazon, I am disappointed in you.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Totally overpriced for what it is.  Go to Petsmart and get a squeaky toy for $.99.  My 7-month old doesn't even like it.  She wants her $2 rattles instead.  This thing is totally useless.  Don't waste your money!,1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"we love so pie, she is so cute. my baby loves to chew chew chew on her and she is so sweet",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My daughter has owned Sophie for a year now, receiving it when she was 3 months old. Sophie quickly became her favorite thing, and it accompanied us everywhere for about 6 months. She loved to chew on it, the squeaky sound delighted her, and she even slept with it. At 15 months old, she is no longer as attached to Sophie as she once was, but she still smiles whenever she sees her and plays with her a bit.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"i looked at this teether forever before i finally broke down and paid $19. for it, it says that the paint does not come off and it does, my son is only 3 months old and is teething but has no teeth through yet but is still able to suck the paint off of it and i wiped it down with a wipe and the paint on her eyes also comes off, i cannot understand why ppl have said that the spots are actually a part of her rubber body because they are painted on and they do come off and im very unhappy about this because i read all the good reviews about it and finallt decided to order it and im very disappointed.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Received a fake one. Paint on the Giraffe started peeling off. It was sold by &#34;SB Natural Products&#34; and fulfilled by amazon.,1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My son first saw Sophie at age 5 months at a friend's house.  He loved her, but I didn't think much of it.  A couple months later he saw her again at another friend's house.  He STILL loved her!  The parents raved about how their kids loved her, so I decided I would buy a Sophie Giraffe.  My son is almost 9 months old and Sophie is a favorite.  He chews on her more than all his other toys combined.  I am glad I bought her.  I never would have chosen her, so I am glad my son did.  I don't think she is cute and she is a bit pricey in my opinion.  If I had just bought Sophie and not all the other cheaper teethers, I would have been money ahead.  I just hope I don't lose her.  I may need to have a spare on hand.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Great feel, great squeek, great quality, great story...Sophie is just great all around. My little man loves her...even though in public I do feel a little odd asking my son &#34;here honey baby, do you want your Sophie doll&#34;? Hubs wanted to rename her to a boy name....but that would ruin Sophie's legacy. My son played with her up to about a year old..I'll be saving her forever in my keepsake box.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This may be my fault, but, I boiled the giraffe after my son got a cold in an attempt to disinfect it and the squeaker stopped working!  My son loves this giraffe.  He still chews on every part of the giraffe regardless of the squeaker being in it or not.  Just sad that it no longer squeaks.....",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Kept her attention for a couple days.  Then stayed at the bottom of her toy pile.  I think I'll give it to my dog.,3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I am so sorry to rename the Giraffe to George but that seemed to work well for our daughter.We were given this giraffe from a friend as a gift and it has been the absolute best!Not sure why anyone would not give it 5 stars. My kid totally digs it.She has had some pretty bad teething episodes and this giraffe not only helps with this but she loves the squeek it makes and the expression on its face seems to really play well with my daughter. Two huge thumbs up!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"When I first got Sophie in the mail, I had some buyers remorse because it did seem like a glorified dog toy.  As soon as I gave to to my 5 month old son he loved it!  It is by far the toy he plays with the most!  He is teething but I think he would like it anyway because it is so easy to grab and squeak!  My husband thinks that Sophie is too girly of a name for a boy toy so he insists that we call him Jerry.  It is really funny.  This toy is on the expensive side but I have to say that it is really worth it!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"The squeeze sound are way too loud which scared my son a couple time. Maybe it will work fine outdoor, but my son did not really like it.",2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"MY SON LOVES THIS TEETHER. HE CHEWS ON THE LEG OR THE HEAD AND SWITCHES IT UP WHEN HE GETS BORED. I WAS SCEPTICAL, SINCE IT'S THE MOST EXPENSIVE TEETHER I HAVE SEEN, BUT WHEN I GAVE IT TO MY BOY HE KNEW RIGHT AWAY WHAT TO DO AND NOW INSISTS ON HAVING THIS.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I have bought one of these for each of my granddaughters and also for my great niece and it is the best teething toy.  No need to buy them anything else.  And they love her too, which makes Sophie even more special. Can't give it 10 stars but I would if I could.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"At first I was skeptical, I mean $17 for a chew toy that looks more like a dog toy? But, after reading the reviews and going nuts with a teething baby I gave it a shot and bought one. As soon as our daughter saw it she smiled (and as you know that's worth a million bucks) and although she wasn't very good with her hands yet, she tried to get it in her mouth. After an incident where our puppy grabbed Sophie and ran around the yard with her we figured we better get a back up or two. Sophie is our go-to girl whenever baby is crying, bored, cranky, sleepy, you get the picture. She seems to make everything better. And anyone with a small baby knows, that alone is worth the $17.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I got Sophie for my baby when she was 3 months old, she is 7 already and still loves it, and others kids who see the Giraffe also get crazy for it!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My little girl is 3 months and teething already so I needed a teether that she could easily hold. I received Sophie today and I think it's a cute toy. It does look a lot like a cheap dog toy but that fact it is made of natural rubber and food grade paint was a plus with me. My daughter can hold it but she wasn't really interested in putting it in her mouth. She still goes for her hands. She did however enjoy me playing with her with the toy. She smiled several times at the giraffe during playtime. I am just going to keep reintroducing the toy in hopes she will use it as teether instead of her hands. I'm not sure this would be a good toy for a baby that already has teeth though because of how soft the rubber is.,4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This is a cute item, however, the box arrived and it was crushed and looked used.  it was intedned as a gift so very embarrassing to have it look like a regift",2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I had put Sophie on my registry, but no one purchased it (I'm guessing the high cost). I knew that I wanted it after reading the reviews, so I purchased it before my baby was even born. My husband thought I was crazy for spending 20 dollars on a little giraffe toy, but he later realized that it was twenty dollars well spent. When I saw my son starting to put objects into his mouth, I knew it was time for the Sophie. This toy has become his favorite toy. No matter where I go, I make sure I have Sophie. It will keep him distracted and entertained for a good time. So in conclusion, bite the bullet and buy Sophie. You'll be very glad that you did.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My baby loves this toy.I give this toy as a baby gift to anyone I know doesn't have it. I have yet to come across a baby who owns this toy that doesn't love it. It has such a nice texture and such a nice little squeaker in it. My little one loves to chew on her ears and legs. It seems to appeal to him that just the lightest grip will make a nice light squeak as well. Perfect shape for little hands to grip.Great product.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Well, my son, who is 4 months, loves to chew on it, anyway he can. So I shoild say, I'm happy about the product.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This little teether is expensive, but I think it's worth it. The long legs will even reach into the back of his mouth to his molars when my ds starts getting teeth back there",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I don't know what it is about this thing, but my daughter loves it. It is the first toy she has been interested in and will look at and try to grab. She is 2 1/2 months. Can't wait to see how it works when she is teething.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I had never seen one of these before and it was a bit of a let down in person.  It is basically a French dog toy. Baby chews on it sometimes, but she doesn't seek it out.  When i offer it to her she sometimes will take it and other times tosses it away. I'd say she is also unimpressed. Not worth the money. I appreciate that it is natural rubber and not made in china, but there is not much to it for $20.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My 6 month old has adored this since we bought it about 6 weeks ago!  He is in the car for 2 hours each day and, unless he is sleeping, he is always chewing on Sophie.  My niece also loves her Sophie and that is why I didn't blink an eye at the price tag.  No regrets!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Received this today. My son enjoys it and the product is as described. But in my opinion it is an overpriced dog toy.,3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Received the product and smells like cheap rubber. This is biggest waste of money. I even soaked it in hot water with soap for couple of hours (over a couple of days) but still smells. I ended up tossing this as this was waste of money.,1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I just purchased Sophie la giraffe for my 5 month old son and it was love at first sight!  He simply loves it!  The toy is very easy to handle with his small hands and the texture is like nothing else!  After all, it is made of natural rubber, not manufactured plastic.  Even the squeaking noise makes him laugh every time! 100% worth the price.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"i know everyone loves this thing, but we took it away from my son when he was 3 months old because all of the paint was rubbing off and showing up on his face and in his mouth.  Just by gently rubbing the body of this thing with your finger will cause the paint to come off in little rolls.  Maybe, the paint is ok to eat, but why risk your baby eating rubber and paint if he doesn't have to.  We are sticking to cloth and wooden toys.",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I read the reviews on this before I bought it and had some concerns but this turned out to be a great little teether for my grandson. I recommend to keep an eye on it all of the time to be sure that none of the bite marks breakthrough.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"i went back and forth for months on deciding if i wanted to buy this product for my son, but because of the overwhelming positive reviews on both amazon and various mommy blogs i decide it was worth the unjustly price tag. i took it out and it was small, flimsy, smelled like latex, and the squeak called my dog over from the other room. i quickly realized that i was paying so much not because it is 'natural', which is a meaningless word anyhow, not because it is bpa free, but simply because it is imported from France. im giving it an okay review because my kid seems to like it, not LOVE it, but he likes to gnaw on it once in a while, it is very overprice, seriously",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I bought this for my 12 month old daughter.  It's good quality but she had absolutely no interest in it.  After a few weeks of giving it to her occasionally and squeezing it, trying to put it in her hands, etc, we put it into storage.  I just gave it to my niece for her 1st b-day so we'll see how she likes it.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I JUST got this in the mail.  Very cute toy.  My nearly one year old daughter likes the squeaker.  But so does the dog!  She's getting teeth in almost every month so this will come in handy.  I love the background story that was included.,4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I bought this for my granddaughter whose name happens to be Sophie.  She's beginning to chew on it's ear. I bought it after I googled top infant toys.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Teething made easier with Sophie - a hit with my grandaughter and it seemed well made- very soft and fun - reminds me of old fashioned toys.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I purchased this for my grandson and he loves it! It is a great teething toy, and is one of his favorites!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My baby loves this. We got it as a gift and it is the best toy ever. She will chew on it for hours!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I'm not sure what it is about Sophie that's makes her so very popular with the very young crowd but my granddaughter loves her. She is 3 months old and just starting to grasp things (intentionally). When I showed Sophie to her she focused right on her and then reached up and grabbed her and had her nose covered with slobber within a minute. She seems to really like her although she's not crazy about the squeaker yet.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"When I ordered Sophie I was excited that it was suppose to do sooooo much for pleasing my grandson. Well, he doesn't use it, the squeak does nothing to get his attention and for what you pay for it, it's NOT worth the money. With ALL the Hype, I thought SOPHIE would have been a wonderful teether, but there are many other things that pleases him more that I should have purchased instead, the Teeting rings are easier for them to HOLD and feel GOOD on the gums. When COLD. Keep your money and get the colorful rings you can place in the freezer, your child or grandchild will be much happier.",2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I think this toy is so cute and I have tried so hard to make it a favorite of my daughter after spending about 20 dollars on it. She'll bite on it for a minute if I hold it up for her, but she will drop it after a few seconds and go to another toy. It was such a highly rated toy that I thought I would give it a shot despite the high price, but I would have to say it was not worth it with how much my daughter uses it.",2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Sophie the Giraffe is the perfect teething toy. She is soft, makes squeaky sounds in both her head and body, and is just right for tiny little fists. My son loves to chew on her ears, horns, and legs. The day she arrived he was cutting a new tooth and just gnawed her a ton. She is really well made, and my older children love to play with her too. When I ask them to get my son a toy, they always pick Sophie. The only downside to Sophie is the cost. I priced out a number of other teething toys, and Sophie was definitely one of the most expensive. After having Sophie for a month though, I would still recommend her. She is worth the price and is one of the few toys that we have that are actually worth what we paid for them.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Someone gave this giraffe toy to my son shortly after he was born. From the first days he began grasping things, he's loved it. He's now 8 months old and still enjoyed playing with it up until recently when I took it away. Unfortunately, Sophie the giraffe has lost most of her spots and most of the brown paint from her feet and head. I'm guessing that a lot of this paint has been eaten by my son. I'm not overly nervous or sensitive about him chewing on his toys, but this possible paint digestion from a plastic toy bothered me. I wouldn't give it as a gift to anyone.",2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My daughter loves Sophie, but we received her as a gift from Amazon. Upon purchasing another one, we discovered the one from Amazon was a fake. The squeaker broke, no blush on cheeks, rough surface, paint peeling off, and legs were not smooth and had pits/divots etc. Sad that someone is doing this, but don't buy here til Amazon resolves. Also, please monitor your child while they are using Sophie. The legs are a choking hazard.",2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My daughter loves to bite Vulli! :-) It is very safe and it helps when she is having some sort of discomfort with first teething. Definitely Recommend.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,It's not a bad toy... but it really does seem like a dog toy. It reminds me of the rubber squeaky bones you can buy at pet stores. I feel like I paid too much for it but if my baby likes it then I won't complain!,4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"The packaging made the item look of decent quality.  However, immediately after opening the box, the item exuded a potent, cheap plastic odor.  After several washings, the odor remained.  The quality of the item seems very poor, and is constructed much like a very cheap pet toy.  It immediately went back into the box and I've just printed out the amazon return label.  I can't believe how many good reviews this item received, which is largely how we base our purchases.",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,This is such such a popular and well tested teething toy that I'm always happy to give it as a gift...as I did in this case.  Another happy baby &#128522;,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My grandaughter loves this as a teether.  She can really chew on it without damaging her gums.  I love the feel of the rubber.  Would recommend it,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Sophie is cute and great for my daughter.  She likes to suck on her face and feet and recently starting chewing on her ears.  I wish this item were cheaper and I'd buy another one for her child care provider to keep handy.  Sophie is very soft and I love that it's not full of chemicals!  That alone makes it worth the money to me when looking at teething items.  Hopefully the price will drop so we can get another!,4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Our little guy is teething early and Sophie is easy for him to ""hug"" and chew, since he is only 3 months and still working on the fine motor skills.  She is big enough that he can wrap his arm around her and chew away.  He loves the contrast between the skin and the spots and smiles when we pull her out.Cute squeek too!  He has already learned to hug her tight to get a little squeek.Just not sure how to clean her, using soap and warm water, but the directions were a bit ambiguous on the proper technique.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Bought this for a gift for my friend and she was delighted.  I have heard so many good things about Sophie the Giraffe Teether.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I had heard that Sophie was a good teether toy, but wow! My son LOVES it!  He will chew on her for such a long time without getting bored.  When he gets fussy from painful gums, I just give him this giraffe.  I will buy one of these for every baby shower I go to from now on.  When I hand her to my baby, he waves his arms and legs and squeals, he is so excited.  Don't be deterred by the price - it is worth it.  I just don't know what we would do if she were to get lost!!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Sophie the Girafee is a simple but well loved teething toy.  My baby loves to chew on its legs and nose. What I love about it, is that it is made from natural materials. A must-have!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I buy Sophie for all the special babies in my life.  They love her.  Best teething toy ever!  Definitely worth the $!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"We love Sophie!! Perfect toy/teether for a fussy baby! Our daughter loves holding Sophie, worth every penny!!! Highly recommend for all babies!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"it's good,but not suitable for everyoneCmy daughter is 8 months and she don't like it, it's a pity and it doesn't worth it.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My son can't get enough of his sophie. He knows who she is by name, we went to someone elses house who had one and he almost panicked that they were chewing on it and it wasn't his. I am so glad we made this purchase, I don't know what it is but he loves it. I will probably pick up the bathtime sophie too because when you get this one wet she doesn't squeak. Def attracts dirt easily though.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I have two granddaughters who so loved these Sophie's; what a great shower gift they are; smell great and are so flexible for infants and toddlers.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,There's something so sweet and charming about this teething toy.  My grandkids love it; her long neck fits securely in their hands and her face has such a sweet look.  And she's safe to chew on (pretty important for a teether!).  I would give this five stars except for the price - over $19 for a teething toy is pretty expensive!,4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"my grand daughter had this teether, she loved it until I noticed the paint coming off. I took it away immediately. So it sits on the shelf. What a waste of money. I never saw a teething toy that had the paint come off in my life. I hope it was not toxic. Maybe it would make a good dog toy.",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,It's super cute. My LO loves it and I love it as well. The squeaky noise it makes is good for distractions when my LO is being fussy..,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,This teether toy is great. For some reason the squeaker fell into the giraffe about a week after I got it. Not sure if it's happened to anyone else. I guess it's kinda nice cause no it doesn't make noise. My son loves it.Was shipped in a very timely manner.Would recommend this product!,4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This toy is good teether and it make a funny sound. We introduced it to our baby at 2 month and till now (8.5 month) she still laugh when she see it and bite it too. The most important thing is that it is a french hand made, so no china here :)",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"i bought this for my 9 month old son for this past christmas when he was 7 1/2 months and started teething like crazy. at first he didn't know what to do with it but was able to easily grasp on its neck and it's legs and before i knew it he was chomping away. this giraffe is so cute and small and made for lil babies' hands and fingers (and of course mouth). he loves to chew on its ears and its hooves and wherever else he can get at. i wish i had known about it earlier when he had JUST started the teething process but as it is, i'm glad that i was able to find out later cuz he just loves this giraffe. would recommend it for every baby!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I received this as a baby shower gift. I had put it on my registry, due to all the good reviews. I'm a first time soon-to-be parent. When I pulled it out of its fancy box, I could already see the paint coming off of the cheeks and ears of the giraffe. When I rubbed the cheeks with my thumb, more paint came off. I can't imagine the paint won't come off when chewed on by a child. I'm not sure if I'll give it to my baby once he is born. I don't want him chewing and ingesting the paint. It's not worth $17. It's dollar-store quality.",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My two year old still loves Sophie!!  She used it as a teether and loved it because it was easy to grasp and it has so many plcces to chew on.  The rubber is nice and soft and the squeak is super entertaining.  I was hesitant at first because of the price and thought it CRAZY to spend so much but I am glad that I did. The hype about Sophie is genuine....it is a great teether and the only one she ever really used as a baby.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My brother and sister in law just loved this. It is the genuine item. Nothing like the other one someone else gave the baby. Sidney loved this one!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I bought this teether/toy for my daughter when she was about 4 or five months old and she just never took it.  She did play with for a few days but just to make it squeak.  She was never interested in it as a teether for some reason.  I paid about $20 for this too, so I was pretty sad that I spent so much for a teether and it basically just went in the toy bin never to be used.  I would offer it to her often but she just wasn't interested.",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I love being able to give my infant a safe toy to play with. Sophie is made with natural rubber and food safe dyes. My son is 5 months and has been playing with Sophie for about a month. He loves her! He already has two teeth so he loves chewing on her. He can easily make her squeak.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This was a favorite toy up until my daughter turned one- she doesn't play with it as much anymore now that she is walking and getting into every thing!  I would highly recommend giving these as baby shower gifts.  This is the third one I have bought from Amazon.  I have found them in local toy stores for $40 dollars- It is not worth that price!  Amazon's prices are great.  Super cute Sophie is easy to clean, soft, BPA free and squeaks!  I will be keeping my daughters as a keepsake.  Happy Shopping!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I got this because my daughter always plays with our friends and she loves it. She does not use it as a teether, but we just had our second child and I am sure he will!! Love Sophie!!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"WoW. That is my one word summary. Originally I had hoped to recieve this very cute toy for my baby girl at her shower, and then I actually got it and realized (with dismay and irritation) that is has a squeeky toy right in the belly! Here i was enjoying the company of family and friends cooing over our new bundle when my older, nine year old, daughter pulled it out of the pile of gifts and started squeeking it repeatedly. I Really wish it would have said in the product discription that it squeeked - I would never have asked for it. It DOES sound just like a dog toy! I had to do surgery and now sophie has a hole on her side. But you live and learn - I should have asked for the Baby Food Puree Book instead!",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"She travels everywhere with us. Great toy to tuck under their arm, spark their attention and to chew on. We are constantly referring to her as our son's ""girlfriend.""",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Sophie the Giraffe Teether.  I have given this to several friends with babies, and they have all loved this.  Also, you can purchase books about Sophie, which I think is excellent.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Do NOT leave your baby unsupervised with this toy! I was doing tummy time with my five month old son and he got the leg of the giraffe down his throat and was choking on it!! If I had not been right there, he could have died. He loves this toy so I won't take it away, I just won't let him have it when he's laying on his belly and he DEFINITELY won't be playing with it without an adult right there. I'll be contacting the manufacturer...especially since I see other reviews on here with the same story! Scary. Other than that major flaw, this is a great toy. The squeaker squeaks really easily, perfect for babies, and the rubber is very soft (but still durable).",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"What can be said that hasn't been said before?  There is a reason why this toy is so popular.  There are many shapes for the baby to chew on, satisfying wherever he/she want to reach with it.  The legs are particularly nice to reach the molars.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This is the most expensive chew toy I've ever purchased. For twenty something dollars I was expecting this to be a nice sturdy teether. The paint came off in my sons mouth, it was filthy in minutes. Not at all was I was expecting from a product with such rave reviews.New moms & First Time moms BEWARE.",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I don't know why I never heard of Sophie before, but my granddaughter has loved playing with this toy from the time she was 5 months old, and is still playing with it at 12 months!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My daughter loves this teether.  It's super soft rubber and easy to keep clean.  The long legs are great for when molars are coming in!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Fast shipping and delivery though the package had a hard time during the freight but the rest is just perfect. Sophie is also the perfect product for baby they just love it ! It must be at least the 5th or 6th one that I buy for presents.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"MY DAUGHTER LOVE THIS TOY FOR HER SON ROMAN.HE CAN HOLD THI S GIRAFFE TEETHER ALL DAY LONE,WITH OUT FUSSING,THANK YOU.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,This came on the timeline given and looks exactly as expected. I have 3 grandsons each of whom had one and loved it. I'm now planning on giving it as a baby gift to three friends who are expecting babies in the near future.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Purchased this for both of my boys and they loved it. It does the job when the kids are teething.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I gave this as a gift to a 6mos old and he loved it.  Easy for the child to grip and chew.  Has a retro squeak too.  Read the pamphlet it has and interesting history.,4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This teether is reserved for future use, it looks cute in the image of giraffe, yet it has a little bit of plastic smell",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Not only did the baby love it, her older siblings kept trying to get it away from her, but she wouldn't budge, she definately made the toy hers.  She was thrilled when she realized if she bites down on it, it makes noises.  It is soo cute, and the knowledge that they are top grade materials is an added plus. Very happy with my purchase.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I am very angry to find out that this teether having serious painting issues. And more surprisingly, it is different from the one selling in store at Baby R US!  I bought this for my baby 3 months ago when he was 6 months old.  However, pretty soon after I got it, I found the painting on the Giraffe's head and legs was peeling off.  So I stopped giving it to my baby.  And just recently I saw a discussion online and a bunch of moms all complained the painting issue with this teether.  And guess what?  They all bought it from Amazon!  One mom pointed it out that the product she got from Amazon looks totally different from the one she bought from BRU.  And she had no painting problem with the one from BRU. So I went to BRU store and checked it out myself.  And I was angry to see it was true!  The Giraffe selling in BRU is light pink comparing to the brown color I bought form Amazon.  I won't say the one on Amazon is fake.  But I won't recommend to buy it on Amazon, after spending so much money!",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I don't know what it is about this thing, but my baby loves it!  She has been playing with sophie everyday since she was about 8 weeks old and she is now almost 8 months.  I really do not see the appeal, but every baby seems to love this toy.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I got this for my son when he was about 5 months old.  He's had it for a month, and loves the squeeky sound it makes as well as chewing on ears, and feet.  It's wonderful!",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"All French babies have a giraffe Sophie, and this since years ! I had my own 40 years ago. It is still a hit and my daughter - who received it as a gift from an aunt - loves it ! I'm also glad to know it's natural hevea and safe (by European standards, so really safe) alimentary paint.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I finally gave in (because I thought it was so cute) and purchased one of these for my daughter.  None of her other teething toys would fit in her mouth. Plus, most of them were hard for her to grip onto. Sophie is perfect. She has so many places to hold and so many small surfaces to chew on. My 2.5 year old also got a major kick out of making the toy squeak. This toy has lasted well after months of use from both a baby and toddler. This is on my list of baby gifts.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This is an absolute must for a teething baby. Dogs love it too! ;) We bought Sophie for my now 3 year old and he still plays with her. The paint fades I've time but it's not a big deal. As with any toy, babies should be supervised while playing/chewing.It is not advised that you put this in the microwave or a sterilizer to clean. Just wipe with soapy water (do not submerge) or use a disinfecting wipe.The shape of Sophie is one of the best things about this toy. Smaller babies, with less control, have an easier time holding onto it. My children start teething at 3 months or earlier so that is very important to me.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I heard the hype about Sophie and didn't believe it!  But as my baby began to teeth, I figured Sophie was so inexpensive that I should give it a try! Sophie is the BEST money I have EVER spent in the world of baby products!  At first I was concerned about the length of the legs, but my little guy loves rubbing them on his gums.  Sophie is his new best friend and a life saver for me!Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether, Brown/ White",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I purchased for my granddaughter who is 5 months old and teething. Honestly, I would have never paid this much for a teething toy for my children, but this has turned out to be her favorite toy.  It is soft and chewable and easy for her to grab and hold on to from many angles.  It was worth every penney.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My wife and I purchased this on-line without ever seeing it.  I of course thought she was nuts but she said we had to have it.  So I purchased it and prepared to make fun of her for wasteful spending.  We opened the box and I laughed for an hour as it looks like a cheap dog toy.Now my wife is laughing because it is my babies favorite toy.  She chews it, hits me with it, squeeks it and loves it so much she even crawls to it.  She just started crawling and will only go after the laptop or the giraffe.By the way it goes everywhere with us.  I guess I should have not purchased all the other toys and just got her this.  Other toys she is tired of in a day.  This darn giraffe she has been playing with for over a month.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,A great stylish teather toy. Easy to clean and all teaching babies will love its easy for even quite small babies to hold.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My grand daughter loved this toy giraffe. Thought it was a little too pricey, but she loved it so much!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I didn't realize that this teether squeaks. I'm sure the reviews mention it, but I didn't even look into it, since everybody has one of these. The squeak is particularly bad since our dog thinks it's a toy for her (and who can blame her). Our 5 month old hasn't really enjoyed this teether so far, but maybe that will change as he gets older. At this point, I wouldn't recommend it.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Every baby needs a Sophie Giraffe.  This is a very hot baby toy for a good reason.  Fun, safe, chewy, and squeaky!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I read tons of reviews on Sofie the Giraffe and thought it was too good to be true. Actually, it is better. My 5 month old teething son adores her. I don't know how we got by without her. Thank you Vulli for making a safe and fun product made in Germany not China.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,DS loves his Sophie and is very vocal while gnawing on her.  The material is good but like others have said it's very comparable to a dog toy...and it's even been mistaken for one!!  The legs are too long in my opinion and DS has gagged on them when he sticks Sophie in his mouth too far.  I really dislike the smell of the rubber but I guess that comes with a rubber toy.  Overall I'm glad MIL gave us this as a gift but no way would I have spent almost $20 on it.  Just sayin.,4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Here is a link of one recall in Germany.[...]It has information of what and where the number should be on the leg.The new and safe Sophie with the help of the batch number, which is printed on the inside of Sophie's left leg. The Sophies with the following batch numbers are definitely safe:321230321300322090322105The reason I have three stars is that I haven't bought a Sophie yet for my son so I can't rate it poorly or great but I am now reconsidering.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I doubt I can add anything that hasn't already been said about Sophie!  She is a must-have for all babies!  This was one of the first toys we gave to our daughter and she has loved it ever since!  We thought we lost Sophie and my husband ordered another one right away!  Well worth the money!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This was recommended by a friend and I have gifted it a few times now at baby showers.  Received a picture text of my nephew this weekend gnawing away on his.  Lots of drool and two fists smashing Sophie into his so far toothless grin.  One warning - the last Sophie I ordered came in a crushed box, since I did not have time to return it for a new one prior to the shower I attached her to the outside of the gift with ribbon like an embelishment.  That is how we discovered that Sophie squeaks - and wow did the dog come running.  If you have dogs you may have a hard time convincing them that Sophie is for the human baby.  Other than that she seems to be a big hit with all of the recipients.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My 4-month-old loves it! It's easy for him to hold and has different bits to gnaw on. I recommend Sophie.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My baby loves this teether. She likes to wave it around and play with it, she loves chewing on it and the squeaking noise it makes causes her to laugh out loud. Love this little toy. I will  be purchasing two more for each of my new nieces.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,We bought this when my son was 3 months old and he has been chewing on Sofie for the past 4 months.  He loves it!  I love it!  It soothes his need to chew.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Added this teether to my cart last minute and really should have read a little closer. I thought I was ordering the harder rubber teether they offer, so I was surprised when I opened the box and this one was soft and squeaky. I love this company's products but could not bring myself to keep this product because it reminded me too much of a squeaky toy for my dogs. The squeaker was also quite loud which I could imagine wearing on my nerves in a very short amount of time. A relative of mine had a baby not too long ago, so I decided to give this to them rather than keep it for myself. I have to say, I felt kinda bad giving it to them when I saw their two year old ""in action"" squeaking their younger sibling's new teether. Hopefully when the baby is enjoying it, the toy won't be quite as obnoxious.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,We love Sophie at our house... she is a great teether and a great toy for entertainment.  Our 18 month old still loves her.  She is the perfect size for gripping and holding and biting... she is natural which is great too... and she is SO cute!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,How can you not love the Sophie Teether?It's absolutely adorable and all the kids love this toy.Will buy more.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Right out of the box and into my little ones mouth. It's a great size for my 5 month old to hold and put into his mouth. He loves the nose, ears and feet. Worth the money.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My daughter just loves Sophie the Giraffe. We have had her for over a month and she still makes my daughter smile. I waited awhile to order her because of the price. If you are waiting please don't you will love her and so will you teething baby,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My daughter started using this teether at 4 months.  She is now six months and it has become her favorite toy/teether.  When she was smaller, she would chew on the little ears and face, and now she's able to chew on the legs and feet.  I've tried other teethers to mix it up, but this is the one that she always goes for.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My son loves his Weedee as he calls it do much I got one as a gift for a friend, quality toy worth every penny!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"When I first recevied the gift I thought it was super cute but was not sure if my baby would chew it. I gave it to her as soon as he noticed her starting to chew on her toys and she hated it. I am sure it is the initial latex taste, but after the second attempt she was hooked. Now Vulli goes with us as her ""car"" toy. We pack her in her the carseat and she now looks around for her friend. She has been chewing on him for months and it is still in great condition. I would highly recommend Vulli - he is cute, easy to clean and babies seem to love him!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"We received Sophie as a gift from grandma, and I'm really pleased we did as I'd never have thought of it myself! Sophie is rapidly becoming one of my four-month-old daughter's favourite toys: as well as enjoying gnawing on the ears and legs, she has recently become aware of the squeaker and loves it (big smiles and giggles ensue) when I squeak the toy for her -- she is now trying to squeak it herself. Highly recommended.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This is a great toy and teether and is the ONLY teether my 5 month old likes.  He is able to grab it easily due to Sophie's slim neck and the legs fit perfectly into his mouth to chew.The price is a bit high, safe for baby and TOTALLY WORTH IT.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My daughter LOVES her Sophie!!!! At first I was hesitate due to the higher than average price point however it has been a lifesaver with a teething baby. I think she really enjoys the shape since it resembles a nipple of a bottle or breast more than most teethers. I have been giving these as baby gifts ever since I bought my daughter one:),5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I got one of these as a showe gift that my baby loves. I wanted to buy another and saw it on Amazon for $19. What a deal considering these are normally $25. So I ordered and am not sure if it's the same and if the one from Amazon is authentic.I realize these are hand painted so there will be variation. But the rubber on the new one smells different and feels slightly harder than my original one. There are also some rough spots on the Amazon one whereas there were no rough spots on my original one at all as you could plainly tell it was very high quality. The sqeaker is not the same in the two versions. When you press on it to feel it, the shape of the squeaker is different shape, size, and sound. My original one squeaks better. The one from Amazon doesn't squeak well, and is higher pitched. The serial number font size on the two are different. The original one had a larger font size and the Amazon has a smaller font size. The most notable difference is the feet/hooves. The original one is thicker rubber and pretty even in thickness all the way around. The Amazon one is thin, very thin at some parts (you can see the think, wavy, crepiness) like the baby can chew through it and the hooves are not the same shape as the one I already have.I don't know. I bought this from  Amazon, but it is fulfilled by an outside vendor and I don't know their reputation. Since this is something that can easily be counterfeited, I am going to return this and buy it at full price form a store I trust, like Nordstrom. It is worth the hassle for me because this is an item that my baby constantly has in her mouth and is sucking/chewing on.Also, mine came in horrible packagin and the box is totally mangled and destroyed and some of the paint on the toy is rubbed off. Not your typical Amazon quality if you ask me.",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"We bought this toy for my 4 month old daughter.  I was reluctant to spend $20 on one teether, but decided to anyway.  She loved it.  We managed to lose it at the park one day, and so we are buying her a new one because it is such a great teether.  It is definitely worth the money.  Since the spots are made from a natural food coloring, they do come off after time, but not a big deal at all.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"If you're going to a baby shower, definately buy this. I always tie one on top as part of the bow. One of the besties for babies and toddlers. My great grandson still loves his at two years.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,We recently received a present of this toy. My 6 month old daughter loves it and while playing with it almost choked only my husband was so close to her. The distribution company passed it off as ""gagging"" rather than ""choking"" ... unbelievable. I am shocked to read SO many similar stories .. it is time to do something about this before something dreadful happens.,1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"After reading about this baby teether, I wanted one for my expectant daughter.  It is precious!  It is safe for a baby, attractive and I can hardly wait to give it to my daughter at her first baby shower.  It also didn't hurt that my dog's name is Sophie!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This teether is super cute! It's soft, it squeaks and my four month old loves it!! Wouldl recommend this to a friend.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Our daughter loves this teether. It goes everywhere with us! It is very easy to wipe clean and she loves the squeaky noise! Although our dog sometimes thinks its her toy. lol It is a great item, in fact we have bought it as shower gifts because our daughter loves it so much.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This is my daughter's favorite teether by far!  So much so that we purchased a second one just for purposes of travel, so we always have one at home.  The multiple angles allow for her chew on various areas depending on where she's having discomfort.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"We bought Sophie for our (then) 4 month old daughter. She absolutely LOVES it! We love Sophie too because it is safe, non-toxic, and so easy to clean! My baby will hold Sophie and ""talk"" to her for hours. She doesn't interact with any other toy like this one. When it's nap time she must have Sophie to hold onto. We will probably be buying a second Sophie in case something tragic happens to the one we have!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,One of the little horns had a whole in it on the top so I don't feel I can let my daughter chew on it in fear more of the plastic will come off and she will swallow or choke on it.,3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I received this toy within the estimated time of arrival. It did not make the squeaky noise. I emailed the seller directly. They shipped out a new one quickly with no questions asked! I would definitely recommend this item (for my 6 month old) as well as this company.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"this is a great toy!! the material is really great, is very easy to squeeze and teething friendly (it seems to be great to bite on) and it also is really pretty.!!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This is the best best best toy/teether!  My son LOVES it and he is always chewing on it.  I have bought this as gifts and recommend anyone with a baby to get one.  Everywhere we go, people say, oh, we have that giraffe too and our kids/grandkids, love it.  Other babies will try and take this, even if they have their own, or they'll ask for one.  Must have!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My 9 month old twins love this teether!  Not having any problem with paint coming off like an earlier reviewer stated.  Sophie is small has an only slightly annoying squeak and is great to have for teething and just playing.  This is a go to baby shower gift for me!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I gave this as a gift to my dental hygenist for her child.  She was delighted with the easy-to-hold giraffe.  This teether toy reminds me of a rubbery giraffe toy my daughter enjoyed so much when she was a baby.  My daughter turns 50 this year.  What's old is new again!!!!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Great book made me purchase his other two books.  He has a way of writing that makes history so interesting especially if you are from Boston area. I have purchased it for a teacher friend and will recommend it to my children and grandchildren. I find great things as well as books at Amazon.com.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My daughter is going through some MAJOR teething right now (pre-molars), so I thought I'd see if Sophie lived up to the hype. My daughter chews on everything right now, so I thought it'd be perfect. Perhaps we got her too late in the game (she's 17 months old), but she doesn't care about Sophie. She doesn't like that it squeaks, and she doesn't seem to like the taste, which is basically just a rubber taste. This is just a glorified dog toy.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I got this for my son expecting it to be something he couldn't put down. He sometimes will pick up and mess with it to make the squeaker go off but that's about it. He doesn't use it as a teether. Otherwise its a well made product its just my son doesn't like it.,4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"When I ordered Sophie I was under the impression she would be vanilla scented as I had seen her in stores.  I was unaware that this item also came in a natural rubber scent.  I feel as if they could have written it a little more clearly before I ordered this item.  The rubber smell is not a terrible smell, but time will tell if my baby enjoys chewing on a rubber smelling toy vs. a vanilla scented toy.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I could not understand why a baby's toy would be so expensive,  but caved into the hype and bought it for my daughter. She loved it and we took it with us everywhere.It is soft, durable plastic and has no stinky,  plastic odor.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"When I first heard about this teether, I thought it was just a stupid expensive yuppie thing that is overpriced and appeals only to people so much money they don't know what to do with it.  I was dead wrong.  My daughter ""tried"" her cousin's Sophie when she was 7 months old and in a horrible bout of teething, and she didn't want to give it back.  I went out and purchased a Sophie for her the very next day.  This is the only teething toy that ever gave her any relief during teething, and she had a terrible time cutting teeth.  The quality of the toy reflects the price.  She dropped her Sophie at the zoo without me noticing one day, and I had to buy her another one. It's that good.  I think Sophie is a perfect baby shower gift, as it is tough for us new parents to justify spending so much money on a teether.  Buy it for a pregnant mom! Or if you can spare the cash, definitely go ahead and buy it for your baby.  I don't think you'll regret it! Note of caution: don't let baby take Sophie in the bath as it can damage her squeaker (short or long term).",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Sophie is our family's favorite teether! She is easy for tiny hands to grip on to, and her hooves get back to the molars, so she's perfect for older babies too!  Our Sophie has survived two babies and yes, she has faded, but she just looks well-loved.  No rubber odor.  Well worth the $$.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Seen many children with this product so decided to purchase one for my child. Noticed that when my child was sucking on the head of the giraffee the colouring on the eyes was coming off and it was all around my child mouth. I didn't expect that to happen!,1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This is just a little baby chew toy but like my daughter-in-law says, &#34;Every baby deserves an overpriced, French chew toy!) She should know-she has purchased several and the kids always seem to love them.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Love it! Love it! Love it!  The best teether I purchased for my baby (I bought several others before finding this one). :),5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"After all the 5 star reviews of the Vulli, I ordered this. I am an enthusiastic, older first time mom (after 4 years of infertility) meaning- I spare no expense on my daughter, but this was truly a waste of money. There are hundreds of other teethers that are far better construction, function, delight, etc. What a disappointment. The one salvation was that its cute- but for 20 bucks?!! A lot of overpriced nostalgia.",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My 4 month old loved it instantly And so did my 2 year old.  It is easy for him to hold and a great teething toy.  When ever he sees it and it squeaks he gets excited and smiles.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"For a baby 3 - 6 months old, it is just the right size to hold and chew on.  Vegetable-based painted detail and the lack of BPA make this an appealing choice from a toxicity point of view. Cute, too!",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Mouth worthy....no crazy chemicals. Lots of places and light enough for small hands to hold. Could be the most expensive chew toy for babies ever, BUT it is a crowd pleaser and ALWAYS a favorite toys for teething babies.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I love Sophie! My grandson has been chewiing on this since age 5 months; - he's 9 months now and still loves it. However, don't leave your baby alone with Sophie; her long legs got rammed down his throat and he gagged and spit up.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"If you have a teething baby, Sophie is worth the money.  Our 9 month old already has 8 teeth.  Sophie has saved us!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,A favorite. It is easy for the baby to hold and it has a lovely squeak. Be sure not to submerse it in water or the squeak will disappear.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Our baby (now 7 months) still love the Sophie. While it doesn't entertain him as much now, his favorite part are the legs. Not all kids may like it, and it is a tad on the pricey side, but it's safe, and doubles as a toy too.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"If you are looking for a safe teether toy for your infant, buy this. It is adorable. I get asked about it constantly.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I was a little hesitant about buying this product because of the price and other reviews, but I am so glad I did.  My infant son loves this toy.  He grabs it by the neck and just chews away on the poor giraffe's head.  When my friend's bring their infants over they do the same thing. I am so glad I bought this toy!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I really had my doubts but my 5month old son LOVES this toy!! When I opened the package I was a little set back I thought that Sophie would be a little bigger. It is a dog toy for all intents and purposes but one that my son loves soooo it's worth it. I did read the reviews on the ""choking hazard"" I would like to say that it could be a GAGGING hazard but that is a HUGE difference between gagging and choking! And despite this my son gags on his own fingers so it's not exactly a danger. If they gag they pull it out of their mouth. I don't think sophie is a huge danger. It's a little overpriced but then again I don't buy many toys for a baby...rattles, a chew toy here and there but nothing expensive to I figure if he loves it then it's worth it!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This children's toy is nostalgic and very cute. However, there is a distinct rubber smell and a very odd taste, yes I tried it, that my baby did not enjoy. Also, if it is soiled it is extremely difficult to clean as the rubber is a kind of porus material and does not clean well. The final thing is the squeaking device inside which stopped working after the first couple of days. I returned this item feeling I had overpaid for a toy that was defective and did not meet my expectations. Please do not be swayed by the cute packaging and hype surounding it as I was. One more thing, I was given a full refund from Amazon without any problem.",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My 4 month old loves this giraffe!  She's not teething yet, but she loves to chew on things, and this giraffe is her favorite thing to chew on.  We have a few other teethers, like the teething rings you can freeze, but she doesn't like to chew on those.  I would recommend this giraffe to anyone who wants a toy that their baby will love!!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,SO after much debate about spending this insane amount on a teething toy.. I went ahead and bought it... The reviews were great and my friends raved about it...however my son is not interested AT ALL in this toy.. we have owned it for probably 4 months now and he has played with it a handful of times.  For ME this was not worth the $ at all.. My little one is much happier chewing on the drawstring knot attached to my hoodie or playing with his books,3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My daughter is teething and it's perfect! All the other teething rings seemed to have some hard areas. Sophie is soft and has rounded edges.  Perfect for a teething baby and peace of mind for parents.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,This is not something you would by yourself....great gift! It is safe and used a ton during the teething phase by my lil one.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Ok. .. so I have heard so many wonderful things about Sophie.  I had a hard time justifying paying twenty dollars for a rubber toy but hey,  if it is a &#34;must have&#34; then I guess I must get it.  So I buy and receive Sophie and (although it resembles a dog toy) give it to my 7 month old daughter.  She is interested in it for a whole five minutes then is on to the next thing.Bottom line: Yes,  it's cute.  Yes it's easy for little hands to hold.... but it is worth the high price?",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Just so you know this does squeak, I missed that when I was purchasing this, so it is very loud and squeaky.  The baby likes it and loves to chew on the legs and head.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Although i thought it was a bit over priced, it is definately well paid for!! Baby adores this teether, the noise, the feel, the size it is perfect for her!!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I was so excited when I finally ordered this product.  I had been wanting to get the Vulli Sophie Giraffe for months.  I read many reviews and most all were great reviews.  My son loved the giraffe.  All was good with this fantastic teether until he decided to chew on the feet.  The legs of the giraffe are long enough to go all the way to the back of a baby's mouth causing choking.  He was using this product when he was 4-5 months old.  If he had been older, he may have been able to pull the giraffe out of his mouth by himself.  So, the $20 teether has been sitting in a drawer ever since.  I am considering buying a different Vulli teether because I did like the product...it's bpa free and a natural rubber.  For future purchases I will be avoiding giraffes, the long legs are cause for concern.",2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"So far the baby is enjoying the sophie teether. We are a little worried about it near the dog though- it has a squeaker (I didn't realize) and we're afraid the dog might confuse it for one of her toys- and for the price we'll be really mad if it gets eaten. Baby is still in the early stages of teething so he's not chomping on it too much, but it is nice variety between frozen teethers.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,This is the best teething toy ever!  My 6 month old loves his ""Sophie.""  It is easy for him to grasp and he likes the squeeking noise.  I was a little hesitant due to the price.  It is worth every penny.  I only wish I had discovered this for my first son.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I had purchased Sophie the Giraffe for my son (6 months old) about two months ago.  This toy has many pros, as well as a couple cons, which I will mention below.Pros:+ Made with natural rubber and safe food-grade paint+ Soft and comfortable for child to use+ Visually stimulating for child's visual growth+ Makes noise which helps entertain child+ Most importantly, keeps child happy and soothed while teethingCons:- Legs are a bit too long, my child has gagged (not choked) on the legs one or two times- The quality is seemingly equivalent to that of a dog-toyOverall, this is the best teething device I have ever purchased for my son.  Much better than a teething ring, and much lighter than the average teething ring.  Definitely helps to sooth my son.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,my little one loved this thing all the comments of kids choking on it I dont see how that is possible unless their trying to deep throat the head,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,The joke in our house is...that this was orginally created as a dog toy but no one bought it so they repackaged it and called it a ""teether"" but the joke is on us because my daughter LOVES THIS. The rubber is really soft and the she loves to make it squeak.Though it is a bit pricier than your standard teethers it is a very popular toy at our house!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My 6 month old loves this!  The squeek keeps him interested while the texture sooths his teething gums.  Easy to clean and fun to play with.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"As other people have posted, this Sophie is FAKE!  I didn't realize it until I compared it to one my friend bought from the big named Toy Store at the higher price.  Her Sophie was more colorful, softer and colorfast.  My ""Sophie"" was already starting to show the colors running, and had a tougher feel to the rubber.  DO NOT BUY this one!!",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My daughter loves her Sophie teether. It is the only thing that fits in her mouth and she enjoys really gnawing on for an extended amount of time. I love that is natural rubber and painted with food dyes too. I think it's a must have for any baby, and I wish I would have discovered her with my first two kiddos.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I had one for my eldest son when he was teething. Bought one for the 2nd boy, and he absolutely loves it too.  Initially I was a little surprise that it came in a size which was smaller than the first one which I had bought somewhere else (From the picture, I cannot tell that actually this teether is sold in different sizes.) Nevertheless, I gave this to my three month old boy and the smaller size is apparently better for him. Though he has not started teething (I haven't seen any teeth despite him constantly chewing), he just loves suckling and chewing on this. This is much better than having him chew on soft toys or other cloth toys (which need constant washing and drying), and the material is also soft and he just loves chewing the ears and the legs.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This little giraffe is the best.  My son has enjoyed it and re-discovered her after his teething period.  When he was done teething, he re-discovered her and started calling her his baby giraffe.  You can't go wrong with this product especially at this price.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"good and comfortable,he don't cry when he got it, he likes very much, and my baby looks very cute and lovely",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Baby loves this teether, as does the cat! I love the fact that it does not come from China so we know that it is lead free..this alone make it well worth the price,,, as I looked everywhere for toys/teethers not made in China.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,This was on a baby registry from Amazon for our niece. It is a very cute teether! I would purchase it again.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I purchased Sophie for my 18 month old son. My first impression when I opened Sophies box was that she was a dog toy retailed for babies! She looks, smells and squeaks just like a dog toy! However, my son seemed to take to her right away. I got her just yesterday and I don't think he's been anywhere without her in his hand. She's very soft, and is supposed to be 100% natural which is a big plus for me! There are some downfalls to Sophie though, for instance she can cost anywhere from 15-20 dollars and for something so closely related to  a dog toy thats quite a lot! Also she does have a very potent rubber smell when you first get her, it gets better with a few washings, but is still there. Also she is unfinished, when I say that I mean that there is no clear coat on her and she is not shiny, which I expected being as she is supposed to be a natural product. However she is very porus, thus anytime she is dropped or your child has grubby fingers she gets very dirty because the rubber holds onto the dirt. She does come clean with some soap and water, but I find myself washing her constantly! Overall I think its a pretty good product and am very happy my son likes it, but I don't think I would spend the money on it again.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Sophie is one of my daughter's favorite toys, and is wonderful as she begins teething.  Love love love Sophie!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I have given Sophie to several infants, beginning with my grandson.  They were only available on the Upper East Side of Manhattan back then.  This was on a registry but I had already purchased it.  I know Itsy will love it.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My 6 month old grandson loves this giraffe, whether he is chewing on it or smacking it around to make it squeak, it's very durable and soft.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Sophie is a little expensive, but worth every penny. My son's pediatrician recommended her and she has saved our ears and sanity  ( and my baby's smiles) on numerous occasions. My husband tried to buy another for our trip to Europe but they were out of stock. We treat Sophie like she is made of gold. My son is 5 months old, so no teeth yet, but he likes to bite while working out gas. Sophie is fantastic for this, as well as being a great toy. She is in the top three as far as he's concerned. We are still trying to get another... Get Sophie while you can!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I don't know why, but our son (9-months old now) loves this toy. Most of the items he liked at 3 Months old barely hold his attention for more than 2 minutes now, but Sophie is still a popular item, especially for chewing and teething. It is one of the only older toys that still make him smile.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Fantastic and the babies love them.  Should become a family heirloom if it survives the teething phase.  Well made and worth the money.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I think most of the people overrated Sophie. My son shows no interest in this teetering at all. He actually likes to grab it and bang it. And the price is wayyyyyyyy too expensive. i wont recommend it.,3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My baby loves it.  Lives up to the expectations I had heard about it.  It is durable, washable, and easy to grasp.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"While the price is slightly high for a teething toy, my son loved Sophie from the moment he saw her. He was about 2 months old when Sophie entered his life and was his favorite teether. She does seem slightly flimsy, almost like a cheap dog toy. However, she endured my son teething and never broke. My son was about a nine months old when he lost interest. Overall, I recommend her as a supplement to the freezer teething rings!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Sophie, oh Sophie, your time has come. My granddaughter, Violet is 5 months old and starting to teeth. What joy little Sophie brings to Violet. Sophie is made of a very pliable rubber that is sturdy but not tough. It is quite easy for Violet to twist Sophie into unheard of positions to get Sophie into her mouth. The little nose and hooves fit perfectly into small mouths, and the drooling has purpose. The paint on Sophie is food quality.Sophie was born in 1961 in France. The maker had wondered why there was nothing available for babies and made Sophie from the finest rubber, phthalate-free on St Sophie's Day, thus the name was born. Since that time millions of Sophie's populate the world. She is soft and for babies little hands easy to grasp. Violet especially loves the bumpy head and horns of Sophie. Sophie has a long neck that easy to grasp and twist. She has lovely, sizable spots that attract Violet's attention. Sophie has happy little squeaks that bring squeals of delight from Violet. She is able to make Sophie squeak and that brings much joy. Sophie's smooth skin is soothing to Violet's little gums. Sophie is 7 inches tall and is the exact correct size for babies to hold and love.As you well know the first thing babies grasp, goes into their mouths- how wonderful to have a toy that stimulates all of the senses and helps with the issue of teething. Sophie is small enough to fit into any size pocket or bag. Sophie is the perfect find for babies from a few months to a year old. How wonderful to hear the giggles and laughs that emanate from babies who find Sophie irresistible. Viva La Sophie!Highly Recommended.  prisrob 12-11-09",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Just adorable.  My 4 month old son really likes this toy.  Very cute, will be buying another for my brother's baby really soon.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I bought this for my daughter when she was three months old.  She is now four months old and we don't go anywhere without Sophie.  For the first month I had to hold Sophie so she could chew on her, but now she can hold Sophie herself.  Her favorite part to chew on is Sophie's face although her front leg and tail are are very close seconds.  We haven't had problems with the rubber cracking or paint rubbing off. Since it's all natural rubber and paint (with no clear-coat), it does have a tendency to hang on to dirt but I just wash it every day with her bottles.  (Some water will get into the squeeker, but it's usually fine after a couple of squeezes.)I'm getting ready to buy a second Sophie so that we can keep one in the diaper bag and one at home.  I reluctantly bought the first one after hearing lots of fuss over it -- I mean.... who needs a $20 dog chew toy?  But Sophie was worth every penny.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Sophie is a classic toy that many parents get at their showers. The product is made of high quality and it does what it should do, soothe a teething baby. It makes a squeak every time it's pushed which can get annoying, but it is on the low end of the annoying squeak spectrum. The legs and shape of the giraffe helps baby get to his molars. It's easy to clean with just a quick rinse.

Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Excellent teething product. At first, I thought this giraffe was over priced but I certainly have changed my mind.  My grandson loves this giraffe and the material is first rate. Thank you for making him calm during a tough teething time.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This is the best teether...and we have 8 or 9. Not too hard, not too squishy. The dye is made of vegetable oil, so it's ok for babies to chew on. The noise is kind of loud (sounds like a dog toy) but the way the squeaker is placed, it rarely squeaks unless you hold it a certain way (when the kid chews on it, it doesn't squeak, like you have to actually try to squeak it). At first I felt like it looked rather cheap (like a dog toy) but the plastic is sturdy and holds up to all kinds of abuse. Got this for my son around 6m and he is currently 21m and still using it now that his incisors are coming in. My biggest issue is it seems to easily pick up lint off the carpet. To clean it, run water over the top while holding it upright (so no water gets inside the toy). My son loves to gnaw on the ears and feet, and there was a time when he couldn't sleep without it, when his teething was really bad.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"it is the one i remember as a kid, what a classic, so happy they haven't messed up with its design like most other classic toys. Great must have!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Sophie has been a huge hit with our little guy.  We got her for him for Christmas when he was 3 months old. He immediately grabbed her and stuck her in his mouth. He has just started teething over the past couple of weeks and she is his go-to teething toy when he needs relief or when he is just feeling cranky from the pain. The squeaky in the toy helps distract him and I can get a smile out of him sometimes even through the tears.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This Works wonders during this tough time. Dipped it in a little whiskey and it works great. FYI, whiskey is for Gpa, not the baby :)",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"When we first got it I thought did my fianc&eacute; buy this for the dog? Why did I think that?, because it squeaks just like a dog toy, feels like a dog toy, and when the dog heard it squeak she thought it was hers to. Yes it is cute and I am sure good for teething but for 20 dollars it is a bit pricy for something that honestly isn't all that different from a dog toy. I would rather have spent the 20 doallrs on a couple other more interesting teethers. (btw: this is written by the mom not the dad)",2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I did not get the hype, but, all babies LOVE it. Dont know why, but ours raomed with it, bit it, held it, etc, Then when teething was over ditched it.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I am always skeptical of baby toys- I mean how many toys would a baby need?.As it is they are busy absorbing the world. I saw a few babies with Sophie, and wondered what the big deal was, but...she looked cute. That was the ONLY reason I bought this for my 8 month old baby girl. It took a few days for her to get a hang of Sophie, but now they are inseparable- when changing diapers and baby wants to wriggle out of my grasp, Sophie to the rescue. I set baby down for a nap in her crib, baby wailing- Sophie to the rescue. It is definitely on the pricey side, but worth it. She makes squeaky sounds, and like the description says, very chewy. Buy it, I don't think you'll regret it- there's something special about seeing your baby smile when you show her;her, sophie first thing in the morning :)",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Sophie la giraffe is absolutely the best toy ever for babies.Every French baby has her Sophie. I don't know a family, a person, a baby in France that has not played with Sophie la Giraffe. Everybody knows her, and she absolutely is a MUST in every family. Her success in France has been lasting for ever: if you look at old pictures of babies, they all have Sophie. And this is for a reason, babies just love her. I can testify that my son can spend an entire day just with this toy and not get bored. each time he sees her he just get so exited and happy. He is 7 months and still loves her. She is much more than a teether.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"For about a month (month 6) this was his favorite chew toy. Now it just sits collecting dust. There's no denying that there's something about the material that attracts infants. It's just a shame that it didn't last very long at all. If I had to do it all over again, I'd probably buy the CPG CHAN which looks striking similar to a nipple. I'm not about to shell another ~$15 on a rubber chew toy that probably costs a fraction of the amount to produce. I should also note there are a couple of undesirable features that you should be aware of with regards to this product. First, be very careful when you wash this thing. If you accidentally get some water in the squeaker it's very hard to dry out fully which makes it rather unsanitary. Secondly, I found the odor of the toy to be a little more petroleum like than I would like. My son never got sick or anything but it was hard to ignore the scent of the toy.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I waited and waited for a sale on Sophie the Giraffe, and thanks to Amazon's Gold Box deal one day, I was able to pick up a Sophie for my daughter. She absolutely loves chewing and squeaking Sophie! I didn't realize she was a squeaky toy, I thought she was a more firm plastic, but she is perfect for my baby to chew on!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My daughter also loves this. She's 5.5 months and teething. She loves chewing on Sophie. She's soft, squeaks and has a pleasant smell.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I was very excited about this product and really only purchased it because of how many good reviews it has received, but I'm afraid to say that my 9 month old son barely looked at it twice. He was actually scared of it at first, but got over that after a little while, and just chose to ignore it completely. He had been chewing on everything and teething terribly, so I was very hopeful. I will say he may just be too old, and if I had introduced something like this when he first started teething at 4 months it may have turned out differently.",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,What baby doesn't love Sophie? It is a great baby shower gift for both boys and girls...I'd give it again. Was going to make it my standard baby shower gift only I forgot to order in time for the last shower!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My son is teething and absolutely LOVES this toy.  Whenever he sees it, he gets so excited and reaches for it.  The rubber and various sizes make for perfect teething.  I highly recommend this and expect to be able to continue to use it as a toy my son will enjoy even when he's not teething.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Love Sophie the giraffe!!! She's so cute. Can't wait to introduce her to my baby girl when she arrives :),5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I just purchased a Sophie for my 6-month-old son after liking the one I saw at my sister's house. While mine looks the same, it is FAR more sensitive as a squeak toy than my sister's is!! I am not a fan of super noisy, annoying toys, so I'm less than thrilled that this one squeaks LOUDLY if you so much as bump it.  The one that my sister has must be squeezed very hard to make a noise.  Not so with mine.The rubber is great.  I like everything else about it.  But I wish I could figure out a way to disable the squeaker.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I registered for this teether and got it at one of my baby showers. It is so cute! It looks like a vintage toy.  The only problem is the squeaker inside it. I'm pretty sure if my son bit down on this, he'd have permanent damage to his hearing. It is uncomfortably loud for me to squeeze at a few feet from my face. I wanted to love Sophie, but I'll go with a less cute teether.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Sophie is a great size for my 3 month old to play with.  He can easily grip her and he can chew on her as he wants.  Love her!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"It is a bit pricey, but our son loves his Sophie the Giraffe!  Even though he doesn't really hold onto things yet he likes to put her feet in his mouth and watch me move her in front of him.  Can't wait until he starts to play on his own with her, it is nice to know she's safe to chew on!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I got this as a christmas gift. My 3 month old doesn't reach yet, and would only hold things for a short time if I put them in her hand. Sophie is the FIRST toy she has grabbed on her own and even puts it in her mouth! Its super easy for her to hold onto. I've tried giving her other toys since and she drops them like usual. I think this will be her first favorite anything!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Although my son love sucking face with Sophie, I got a used one on Craigslist that has now been through 2 kids and is just great.  The recently purchased one from amazon though is a lighter color, slightly harder material, and splitting at the seams in 2 places after only being out of the box for 48 hours.  My son is 3 months old and obviously did not do this.  I tried contacting Vulli with no response.  I am very disappointed with the customer service and quality for such an expensive chew toy.",2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Sophie is a fantastic teether toy, my son loves giraffes to begin with so imagine when I found this teether I had to get it for him.  It is a great toy for babies to chew on, soft and firm with just enough give to relieve their need to chew. The only thing is DO NOT try to microwave sterilize this as I did.  I chock it up to first time mom stupidity...  It ruins the squeezing mechanism that produces the little squeak sound when you squeeze it.  I don't think the baby cares, as he still chews on it all the time and loves talking to it too!  Still probably a nice ""toy-ish"" feature that I ruined.  As tempting as it is to replace, there is nothing wrong with the teether other then the sound so I am stuck with.  Just don't do it for yourself so that the baby might enjoy the noise maker as well.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,The baby loves chewing on it and is able to maneuver it around very well. The softness of the rubber is great.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Our daughter loves her Sophie.  It is soothing for her gums and helps with dexterity.  She is learning to move Sophie from one hand to the next.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My daughter is 4 months old and will not take a pacifier.  My neighbor got one for her son and told me about it.  I figured I'd try it out.  I also bought one for my nephew, who also won't take a pacifier.  Both babies love her!  She is easy for them to hold and to get into their mouths.  My daughter really loves chewing the feet!  I tell everyone about Sofie!  One of the best toys so far!!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My baby loves this teether.  We always leave it at home though, because I don't want to chance loosing it because of the price.  I nick-named it ""Seventeen Dollar Sophie."" lol  The only slight dissapointment I had was seeing that this $17 toy was kind of small.  But it is really perfect.  If it was any bigger, she wouldn't be able to hold it well.  We love it.Tip - If washing with water, hold your finger over the little whole. Any water that gets in would be hard to get out and could harbor germs.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My 4 mo Grandbaby LOVES her Sophie. Since everything goes in her mouth, Sophie is a kind toy to her mouth and has lots of different pert that she loves.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I bought this for my daughter at 5 months. She absolutely loves it. It is easy for her to hold on to and she has chewed on about every inch of it possible. She is very amused by the squeaker too. My toddler is even amused by it. I definately recommend it.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This toy i do not like. they should make it a bit smaller. i think it is a little big for my daugther's hand, she was about 6 months when we got it and then water always gets in it.",2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I bought this for my granddaughter based on the advice of a new mom.  Apparently, this is the must have product for babies.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I've tried so many and this is the only one he loves. Definately add to your registry or give as a gift. You will not be disappointed.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This is such a great product. Unfortunately, it arrived in a very smashed condition.Sophie is unharmed but it's a gift so it looks pretty bad. Just go to Target and buy Sophie in the store.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Very cute giraffe and so soft. My only complaint is that I purchased this item for a baby shower and it was shipped in a box with a microwave; therefore, the box was smashed when it arrived.  Didn't want to give a smashed box as a baby gift, but don't like to give teething items unboxed... put it in a gift basket with other items.  I hope they'll still use it, it is adorable.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I was nervous about spending so much on a toy that my dog would potentially steal but my daughter loves it and talk to it all the time. She gnaws on it constantly and  would recommend.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Ok so I had heard of Sophie the Giraffe before and thought to myself ""why would I spend so much $$$ on this teething toy when I can just buy my baby a cheap little one?"" well I got one from Secret Santa and let me just say, I would deff buy it! he ignores all his other teething toys and just uses this one. Its so cute and he can use it in every angle, he puts the ears, feet, top, even front of Sophie in his mouth. Its also funny because his gums squeak and its cute. BUY THIS TEETHER!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This is my second time purchasing Sophie for a wee one, and each time they love it.  It is an excellent teething toy.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Such a cute toy.  My daughter loves it.  It is soft and has a cute little squeaker in it too.  She loves to chew away on it and gets so excited when she finds the squeaker.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This toy is the perfect toy. My 3-month old grandson can hold onto it and when his mom is desperate, she'll have him suck on the face, because the shape is good for that. While babysitting a very unhappy child (not my grandson) I stuck his Sophie's foot in his mouth, and instantly he went to chewing away on it and peace prevailed. It's soft but durable and the neck and legs are great for little hands to hold on to. I suggest getting 2 and keeping one put away in case one gets lost, because the little guys get attached to Sophie right away.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I was excited to have this high-rated toy for my baby. However, as soon as he started chewing on it, the black from the giraffe's eyes starting coming off and running into his mouth!",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Other moms have recommended this toy to me, but honestly I can't really rate the toy yet since I bought it for my son as a Christmas gift and it's not Christmas yet.  I'm hoping he will love teething on the giraffe.  It's cute and looks perfect for little mouths.  Time will tell how great this product really is.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I bought it for my 8 month old (I know it's late) from another merchant.  She did not like it. Does not play with it, does not enjoy it, and does not teeth it at all. It does not feel like a $25 toy. Right now, it's on sale on Amazon and so not that bad but it's a simple squeaking tether. Agreed it may be safe due to food grade paints and such but for $25, you can buy much better toys. I think it is over-hyped and overrated. The fair price should be around $8 and $15 is maximum of what someone desperate to buy it should pay.",2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My nephews and my four kids all had Sophie in the 70's and 80's, and Sophie hasn't changed: she is still the perfect teething toy!  She is the perfect size, the perfect weight, the perfect material.  Babies can grip her easily, hang on easily, and chew on multiple places.  She's great in the bath too but her squeeker gets water-logged for awhile.  She's perfect; a timeless toy!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"What a waste of $20. I don't know what all the hype is about. It's just a tiny squeaky giraffe, I could have gotten any tiny squeaky toy that my baby put in his mouth and called it a teether and sold it for $20.My baby is 4 months old and doesn't care much for it...",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Yes. It looks like a dog toy, sounds like a dog toy, and feels like a dog toy. People will give you funny looks... But I can't say enough about Sophie. My 4 month old got her today, and this toy has gotten her to use her hands much more than anything else she owns. She loves to hold it and suck on its head. She gets a huge kick out of it when she manages to squeak it.Buy this toy. It looks like you spent a lot of money on a dog toy, but your child will love it and learn from it!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,When I washed it off. Water got in thr squeaker and it stopped working. It took days for it to start working again. I almost returned it. Now I have to put my finger over the squeaker when I clean it off and it does fine.,4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I held off on getting this teether thinking someone would get it for me as a gift.  When I didn't receive it as a gift, I finally broke down and bought it, despite what I thought was a high price.  The second I took Sophie out of the package, my daughter fell in love with her.  Sophie is soft and apparently very comforting to chew on.  My daughter loves her.  She chews on her head and her feet and it really seems to help while she's teething.  I wish I hadn't waited 7 months to buy Sophie.The only drawback (and this is no fault of the toy/teether itself) is that my dogs are obsessed with it because it is so similar to their dog toys.  They wait for my daughter to put it down and then try to grab it.  I have to keep it out of their reach whenever my daughter isn't actively using it. (Trying to teach them not to touch it hasn't worked yet.) In response to the person who said it is a dog toy - it is NOT.  Yes, it sounds a bit like one and is the texture of one, but it is SAFE for babies to chew.  It is natural rubber and it is made with food-grade paint - unlike all of the dog toys that I have (and have seen).  It was designed specifically for a baby - it is the perfect shape to hold and gnaw on.I am certain if you have a teething baby, you will love this toy!  Just be sure to keep it away from your dogs!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"A friend bought me Sophie as soon as she found out I was pregnant.  She said I had to have her, but I was skeptical.  I first gave it to my daughter around 3 months, but she wasn't interested.  Then around 6 months, it suddenly became her favorite thing in the world.  She loves to chew on her ears and her feet.  She can grip it nicely around the neck and wave it around, making it squeak (yes, it squeaks!) when it whack against something.  She comes everywhere with us - in the car set, to the doctor to distract her from shots, when we're out shopping to keep her occupied if I have to finish something up.  I'd say Sophie is a must!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"my 6-month-old daughter LOVES Sophie. She has so many places to chew on and is easy for her little hands to hold on to. She chews on her legs and ears and nose, but even more than that she likes to grab sophie around her neck (somewhat disturbing to see sometimes) and squeeze her repeatedly to hear the squeak! The squeak was a problem at first because my dog thought the toy was for her. When my sister visits with her young husky, we have to keep Sophie away because the husky tries to steal it from the baby! My daughter loves the attention from the dogs so she thinks it's great, but I could see where it would be a problem if you have a younger dog who might be more aggressive about taking Sophie away. I was slightly worried at first from the reviews about Sophie's legs being a choking hazard, but I haven't noticed that at all. My daughter might have gagged on one of the legs at first, but she gags on her own hands more than she does with Sophie. And gagging is certainly different from airway obstruction. I would recommend Sophie to all my friends (who don't have ambitious dogs!)",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I've never met a baby who DOESN'T like Sophie.  She's a legend in our home, where my daughter does not take a paci but loves to chew on Sophie!  I received an extra by mistake from my baby shower, but am sure glad I did, because if one falls on the grocery store floor or something, there's another clean one at all times.  Also, when we have play dates, it's nice to have two, because inevitably both kids go for Sophie.  We also have the bath tub Sophie which isn't quite as awesome due to a different texture, but still gets lots of love.  Some things are worth the price, and this toy is!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Definitely recommend teether. my son LOVES him his Sophie la giraffe teether  he even sleeps holding the toy with him. :),5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My son LOVES his Sophie.  He has had one since birth and I have bought one for each of my friends for a baby shower gift.  He chews on her all of the time!  I love that it is made from natural rubber and food grade dye and it can be washed with soap and water.  He loves her so much that most of her spots are worn off.  Best teething toy ever! And she is so Cute!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Sophie is great! My son started using her at 6 months and he takes her everywhere now. He loves to chew her ears and legs and can easily grab on. Would recommend this product.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This is the best teether.  He loves it.  He can chew it, squeek it, beat it, and so on.  I'd buy this for any baby.  I don't know what we'd do without Sophie.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This popular item warrants the high praise.  My baby loves her Sophie. She licks, bites, plays and sucks on it. It's a great toy/teether.  You can always buy this product in advance, but I found out that my baby wasn't able to really use this toy until she was 5 months old.  The reason is that her hand/eye coordination before 5 months isn't that great.  She would try to put the giraffe into her mouth but misses it by a mile.  She then gets really frustrated.  Now, she's 6 months and she can place the toy into her mouth by herself and is having a fun time with it!",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I've given this many times and each time I get &#34;it's just what I wanted!&#34;  Super cute and practical.  I've seen it in use!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My son isn't teething yet and hasn't really used this toy but I must say I appreciate that it's constructed well and isn't made in China:),5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My son had a Sophie when he was a babe and it was well-loved. I had hoped to find one for his daughter and was pleasantly surprised when the option popped up while I was looking for an infant car seat.  This little giraffe is the perfect size and flexibility for a baby who is teething and just beginning to hold objects. And infants seem to love the face and spotted body.  My grandaughter loves to hear Sophie squeak.  Go ahead, buy one, even though it may seem expensive.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I purchased Sophie the Giraffe for my granddaughter  6 months ago, when she was first born. Sophie has been her constant companion since she was old enough to hold it and chew it, i.e approximately 4 months old. This is better than  a teething ring as it is easier to hold onto.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"The giraffe itself is cute, like another review I saw, I agree it def. isn't much different than a dog toy, it's soft rubbery and squeaks just like one, not to put it down but I have dog toys that feel and squeeze just like it  LOL It was smaller and flimsier than I thought it would be, it was a very expensive trial and error teething toy, My son just would not chew on it no matter how much I offered it to him, he would rather chew on a blanket. At first I thought maybe it had a funny taste because it has a rubbery smell at first so I washed it several times rinsed it well and tried again with no avail he just didn't like it.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I was very excited getting this product but my son was not interested in it in the least.  Very disappointed.  I will not recommend this product to anyone not to mention the price for it is ridiculous.,2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My son really likes this toy, but not necessarily more than his other toys. I still like it though. The only downsides are that it is too expensive and also the squeaker became dislodged about a week after we got it, so it does not make noise any more. So sad.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My daughter LOVES Sophie!  We purchased one and then purchased a ""back up"" just incase some thing happens to the first one! Sophie is probably in 50% of the photos we take of our daughter ~ it's her favorite toy (she is 9 months and still loves Sophie),5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Baby shows absolutely no interest in this toy.  Refuses to put it in mouth even though likes gumming on just about everything else.  The giraffe has a chalky rubbery texture so I can understand why.  We use it as a squeeker.  I like that it is made in France.,2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My 5-month old played with Sophie off and on for a few days and now she isn't interested in it at all.  It seems like a quality product, but she's just indifferent to it at this point.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I had high hopes for this highly praised teether.  Baby loves to chew on it, but only for short amounts of time.  It's the taste of rubber that baby finds unappealing.  I have washed the toy in warm soapy water several times and still cannot get rid of the rubbery taste.  My son will chew on it, then gets a look of disgust across his face, chew on it more, drools, more looks of disgust, then eventually drops it.  I put it in my mouth to see what all the weird looks are about and sure enough it has a weird rubbery taste no matter how many times I wash it.  After my baby is done chewing on it, I go to give him a kiss and his mouth and cheeks smell ""rubbery"".  I also have to watch him closely because the giraffe legs can easily gag baby, but that's his favorite part to chew on, of course.  Other than those two gripes it's a good teether.  It's soft, good size, cute, and my son is attracted to it.  Just wish I could make it not smell/taste so bad!",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Sophie was a lifesaver during my daughters first year.  She started teething around 3 months, which is when we bought Sophie.  She loved it from the first second I gave it to her, and she barely put it down over the following six months.  In fact, she liked Sophie so much that I started buying Sophie's as gifts for other babies we knew.  They loved them just as much as my daughter.  This is a safe and excellent way to help your child through teething.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My daughter (5 months)really isn't into it, which is a bummer since it is the priciest teether I've ever purchased....Also, when it squeaks it reminds me of a dog toy. It is a little odd. I love giraffes, maybe she will like it more in a few months.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Easy for baby to handle and of course make its way to the mouth for teething.  Made in Canada so no chinese lead fears either.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My son loves this. He his 16 weeks and it is one of his favorite teethers.  This is although not a toy I would ever let him play with without me near him and watching closely.  The legs are long and slim and he likes to shove them in his mouth. The issue is that the legs are also close together so at 16 weeks they legs actually can get stuck on his inner and outter checks. Although he has not gagged or choked YET I have read of other babies doing this.I only allow play time when I am holding him with the toy. If he didn't love it so much I would return it.,3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I was expecting something make of a harder plastic, like the one a friend of mine has. This had a more...rubbery dog toy consistancy. My daughter still chews on it, but it doesn't really do much in the way of teething.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I berated myself for purchasing a $22 teether, but my baby has used it to cut six teeth so far and it still looks brand new.  Not sure what it is about this toy over other teethers I bought for her but she definitely favors it.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This is the BEST thing for children who are teething! As soon as I know a friend is pregnant, I order and send it to the new mom!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This is a tether and so much more. I love that it is &#34;green&#34;.  It has textures, sound, and a variety possibilities for chewing.  The legs are long and are good for developing chewing skills.  The ears are bumpy and are good for exposing textures getting ready for foods.  Awesome toy.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"the giraffe is very very smelly. i've been airing it and hope the smell would go away, but it's still very strong.whenever my baby holds it in his hands, his hands would be smelly too.my baby doesnt like chewing it, so i'm glad. i am not sure it's as safe as what it's proclaimed to be, because the smell is just too strong.what a waste of money... i guess at least my baby likes to look at it. that's all.",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Seems a bit silly to me, but this giraffe actually does have a pretty cute face and smile, not that some babies could even focus on it, at least in their early infancy.Sophie is quite soft and malleable, nice, pretty brown spots, with a pleasant &#34;squeaker&#34; in her.  She's a much better thing for babies to chew on than plenty of other things they might put into their mouths.  Washable, but from what I'm reading, don't wash Sophie in the dishwasher or in especially HOT water.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I had a Sophie I had forgotten I bought.  Also from Amazon.  Recently I purchased another.  The box on the recent one looked a  little ""off"" to me so I came here looking for answers.  The new box, instead of saying Vulli in the upper right hand corner, says, ""Sophie la girafe.""  This fake one has fluorescent pink on the tongue and cheeks and SMELLS like chemicals.  It also has lighter paint for the spots and doesn't stand on it's own.  The genuine one has a serial number on the back of her leg, the fake one doesn't have a serial number.  This is a real shame.  BOTH boxes have stickers on the bottom that say, ""imported & distributed by calisson inc.  [...]  I've ordered several over the last few years.  I hope I haven't given bad ones to babies.",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I bought Sophie as a teething toy after reading many great reviews and I'm so glad that I did.  Our baby boy is 5 months old and has been teething for 6 weeks already and he chews on her regularly to help his pain. Other teething toys are so hard and she is softer and rubbery which is very soothing to his gum's. Sophie is BPA free too - a total perk!This adorable giraffe is easy for little hands to hold and she's light enough for them to get into their mouth. Sophie squeaks like a dog toy so if you have a dog like we do, there may by a little of confusion when the dog sees baby chewing on a toy that they think should belong to them because of the noise.Sophie comes with her story of origination that is as charming as her ""classic toy"" look. I recommend purchasing Sophie for any teething baby.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My 8 week old LOVES Sophie. The rubber feels so soft and smooth, the legs almost feel like fingers for her to grasp, and she loves chewing (or ""gumming"" to be more accurate) the little ears and horns.  Sophie is the only toy she has shown any interest in so she was well worth the price in my opinion.  Her little squeaker is so sweet!  She also comes with a wonderful history, having been created in the French Alps in 1961 and remaining unchanged since.  She's hand made using natural rubber and food quality paints so no toxic chemicals!  She's such a hit that I plan to make Sophie my standard gift to mommies from now on.  I can't recommend this toy highly enough :)",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This is the perfect toy for a new baby. Santa brought this to my newborn, and she loved it since the first time she had it. She was playing with it from the very first moment.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I didn't realize how soft the material is and that it squeaks when pressed. I love it and try to get my baby interested in it but he just passes it by. If he were squeaking it all the time though I would have to restrict his time playing with it so as to not go crazy.,4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I seriously don't know what all the fuss is about this thing.  Yes my daughter likes it somewhat but she is not IN LOVE.  Doesn't like it enough to justify $20 on a chew toy.  I say chew toy because I've had several people tell me they thought it looked like a dog toy.  Waaaaaaaaay overpriced.,2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"We received the Sophie on a Wednesday and by Monday, with minimal use by my 5 month old, the squeaker was completely broken. She vaguely enjoys the feet and head for chewing, but it definitely is not the be-all and end-all of teethers, especially for the price. I expected it to be much higher quality and much more sturdy for almost $20.",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My daughter loves it! I have had no problems. I did not get it for her until she was 9 months old. I wish I had gotten it a few months ago. I would recommend Sophie to  any parent with a teething baby.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Before you buy an expensive teether like Sophie the Giraffe, figure out if your baby even likes teethers by trying a cheaper, BPA-free one from Target ($3).  I found out my baby is indifferent to teethers AFTER I bought Sophie for $21.  He prefers his hand or thumb. He simply looks at Sophie, then looks away.",2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I never got hang of it when I saw the price and reviews... but this giraffe is great.. my daughter loves it.. she stops crying as soon as she hears the squishy noice of this.. and screams by putting this in the little mouth and taking it out..  my niece who is 2yrs old also wants one.. :) ..,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I bought this for my daughter when she was 9 months old.  She's now 26 months and throughout this time Sophie got about the same amount of use which was little to none.  My daughter liked it at first but just for an hour, after that it went into her pile of toys.  She never used it to chew on or carried it anywhere.Overtime it has faded and all the spots are off which was a huge disappointment considering the cost of this teether.  She occasionally picks it up now and makes it squeak and brings a smile to her face then it gets tossed aside again.  There were many other much cheaper teethers that she had which she used a lot more.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Not worth the $16-17 for my kid. She barely plays with it, i find myself dangling it in front of her to get my money's worth - hardly what I was shooting for when I bought it. It is cute, maybe somebody's baby loves it, but not mine. I think it just doesn't do enough to keep her entertained. There's no bells and whistles, just a squeak toy. I'd say if your child is already to the point where they are playing with toys that function by pushing buttons, this giraffe is not going to keep their interest. My baby IS TEETHING, but this toy does not satisfy her need to chew, she likes cold water-filled teethers.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Going by the Amazon reviews, there was too much hype for the product. My 10 month old son does not care about the giraffe much. Though it is well built, it is definitely not worth the price. This also comes a small booklet that contains the story of Sophie and contains phrases like ""jealously guarded trade secrets"". Think twice before buying.",2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,The neck is just the right size for little hands to grab and all of the edges are perfect for teething,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,We received this as a gift.  Our baby loves to chew on it.  He is 9 months now and has been using it since we was about 4 months old.  It is one of our favorite toys to hold onto and chew.  It also washes up easy for when it falls on the floor.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My little one does not like it. This product has an odor to it. Washed it and it still smells.,3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Let me be the 1,3777th person to review Sophie the Giraffe.  (I know, what's the point after 1,376 reviews, right?)  Will this review ever be read, besides the amazon guy or computer screening reviews?  And still... like the 1,376 before me, I will have my say too.My crazily teething five month old adores this thing.  Yes, it's overpriced.  I heard this giraffe sells for a dollar or two in France and that ""poor"" kids play with it there.  That's probably true, but whatever, I don't really care.  All I know is that my teething infant loves Sophie (and chews on and abuses her dreadfully, and she takes it all with nary a complaint) and that's enough for me.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I purchased this for my grand-daughter for Christmas. Since then she has cut her first two teeth with Sophie. She loves this teether! It is easy for her to hold on to with the legs or neck. It's soft, smooth texture is also pleasing to infants.  We were out shopping one day and she saw another little baby with a Sophie and she wanted it. Of course, we had forgotten hers that day!. This is a great teether and would make any child happy. Would make a great gift since it is a little more costly than most teethers, but well worth the money>",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,We adore this little giraffe; it was the first thing we bought when we found out we were pregnant.  Timeless!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This is a no brainer... this toy is like baby crack. Every baby I know adores Sophie. My daughter now loves her for the squeak, but she chewed on every part of Sophie's body for the entire first year, pretty much. I love that it is made with natural materials. What is the mystery of Sophie? My husband and I think it must be because it's such an interesting shape. Most baby teething toys are round, or some simple but geometric shape. This one has fun bendy hooves, wiggly ears, and a most excellent nose to gnaw on. It's a toy I buy for every friend who gets pregnant.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"An excellent toy for teething babies - it is so much better than anything in the market. I saw my friend's daughter playing with it and loving it; at first I thought that the sqeeks can be too loud ( me and my baby hate loud noises), but he got it a couple of days ago and he loves it. He just turned three months and most other teething toys are too heavy for him to hold, or too difficult to grab on - Sophie is very light and easy to hold. He chews on her ears and legs, when the toys slips out of his hands he likes to look at it. This morning before falling asleep he was looking at his giraffe and smiling. The two cons are the rubber smell (it took him some time to get used to it so he could put the toy in his mouth) and price. It is slightly overpriced ( guess due to its popularity and advertising, other vulli toys are cheaper), but when a baby needs to chew on something and nothing seems to work, most parents are willing to pay extra for a safe and lovely looking toy.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,When I received this the paint was peeling off in places.  I put it through the dishwasher to see if that would help but more kept peeling off so I threw it out.  Terrible product and unsafe to give to babies.  I know everyone raves about this giraffe and I think it would have been great had it not been for the paint.  Not worth the risk.,1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Had one for my first two children but it had seen a lot of love so I bought another one for my third child. I don't know what it is with these giraffes, but babies just love them. They are easy to hold, soft to chew on. Great baby-toy and something I buy for new parents.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I purchased this teether for my daughter when she was 4 months old and she loved it right away. It was the perfect size for her small hands, easy for her to hold on to and the material is perfect for chewing on. Now she is 7 months old and she still loves it. The neck and legs make it easy for her to hold and shake before she bites down. There are some areas where the paint has rubbed off, but not in chips or chunks. I was worried about the ""choking hazard"" that other reviewers mentioned, but she has never had a problem. The legs are not long enough for her to jam down her throat, and the head is too big and awkward with the ears sticking out. It really does look (and sound) like a dog toy, but as much as she loves it, it was worth the price.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"It makes happy squeaking sounds, is safe for baby's teething, is easy for baby to hold onto, and it's basically indestructible.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"There is a reason there is so much hype surrounding Sophie - she really is THAT amazing. Always a great shower gift, Sophie manages to make children adore her without crazy bright colors or vibrations or flashing lights. Just a simple almost vintage feeling design, a silly squeaker sound we squeezed, and somehow both my infant and even his 4 year old brother just adore Sophie and she gets daily play. This was the first toy my infant son learned to grasp, at only 2.5 months, and is a must have item whenever we pack the diaper bag. In fact Im looking to buy a backup Sophie just in case anything ever happened to the first - dont know what we would do without her!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My baby loves this giraffe.  He loves to look at its face and has figured out how to make it squeak.  And of course he loves to chew it!  I'd give it five stars if it were a little less expensive, but all in all, great baby toy!",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"We did not purchase this from Amazon, but received it as a gift.  Overall, we like this teether, it smells pleasant, it's soft, looks friendly and a cute little squeak.  The only concern we have is if he could choke on the legs.  We feel that we should always supervise our 2.5 month old.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My wife and I were skeptical at first because of the price. I mean $15 for a rubber Giraffe. Because of all the great reviews we decided to get it anyway. Our daughter is 5 1/2 months old and she will chew on Sophie's legs for a half and hour without a problem. Anyway needless to say we love Sophie and recommend it highly.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My daughter instantly loved Sophie when I handed it to her.  This is perfect for her gums and her tooth that is coming in.  I highly recommend this to every mom and dad.  My daughter is a lot happier!!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I bought this toy for my 5 month old daughter.  It's ok, she enjoys it, but it isn't her favorite teether.  I would not spend the money to buy another.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Thank you very much receipt of the product, which was in excellent condition and in conformity with the specifications mentioned in the presentationI hope all the shops dealing directly with Saudi Arabia",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My mom used to talk about a giraffe toy my brother had as a baby.  When I ordered this for my son, she was surprised and said this was the same toy she always talked about!  My son wasn't crazy about any other teethers, but loved Sophie.  I've since gotten this as a gift for several friends/family members as gifts for their babies.  Love!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Very pretty, safe material, good to pratise grasping with, different parts can be chewed on. My baby looks so cute when she holds the giraff in hand.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My 9 mo instantly took to this teether - it became his favorite.... and I love this its natural rubber. I hate him putting plastic products in his mouth!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"When we first got this teether in I thought it was just a glorified dog toy. It squeaks and it's rubber, I was like whats the big deal, It just drives my dog crazy. My son at first was the same way, but once his teeth started hurting and the started bitting on it he Loved it. It was Love at first Bite. I have it in our diaper bag at all time because for some reason this giraffe can calm him. I don't know how it works but it does. This teether has helped this mom out a lot during those stressful teething times.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Baby D never leaves home with out his Sophie!  I like that he likes it, and that it's made of natural materials.  Super easy to squeek, but the dogs get confused! LOL!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Bought this for my 4 month old nephew who was teething. My grandaughter also has one and loves it. Just the right size and feel. Has quickly become a favorite. I think they would highly recommend Sophie the giraffe!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I bought this for my teething puppy, and I love that my puppy loves chewing on it. I know it's a bit unusual to buy a baby toy for a puppy, but I noticed that my puppy didn't particularly like all the tough chew toys out there. So, I did a little research and found Vulli. My puppy loves chewing on Vulli because she is soft and squeaks easily.One thing to note is that Vulli is extremely soft compared to typical dog chew toys so if your puppy is rough, he can easily puncture Vulli. I actually made the mistake of letting one of our friends' adult dog play with Vulli, and he instantly chewed a hole in Vulli so that she no longer squeaked. I quickly ordered a replacement, and Vulli has survived the many weeks my puppy has played with her since.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Really great for the tiny ones.  Easy to hold and chew on at the same time. Really likedthe productand will reccomend it.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Very fast delivery!  I can't wait to give it to my new neice!Thank you!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My son loves this toy! It's perfect for when your little one is teething. Becareful if you have a dog that likes sqeaker toys. The first time my son squeaked it our dog ran right over to it. Now we have to watch to make sure the dog doesn't try to grab it. :-),5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My daughter got this when she was around 3 months old and just loves to gnaw on her little giraffe and to squeak it!  Super cute!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My daughter, now 7 months old, adores her Sophie.  Yes, it does have a very faint smell (the rubbery odor on ours has faded until it's nearly gone and we've not had it that long), and I still don't really let her play with any toy unsupervised, but she loves to hold it, bite it, squeeze it, squeak it and pass it from hand to hand.  I really love this little toy.  It makes her smile every time she sees it, it's her preferred teether, and of all the toys and teethers she has that are top-rated on Amazon it's this one she loves the best. She reaches for it every time, and I'm using it to help her practice crawling.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I love this toy, it even has a little squeaker inside. My daughter loves it too. She looks so cute chewing on the body parts. My husband does not like the toy very much. He thinks it looks like an expensive dog toy.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My son (now 2.5) LOVED his Sophie, and I bought one for every baby shower I've gone to. Now, my daughter (6 months) just today nearly choked on it and I will never give it to her again. Had I not been within hearing range it could have been fatal. The strange sound she was making caught my attention and when I went to her and found the front curved leg shoved well down her throat and her face a purply/blue I panicked. I pulled it out and she vomited all over the carpet before screaming her head off. I can't believe how my opinion of this toy has changed from a must-have to a must-not-use. Please don't disregard any of the choking hazard comments, they are not over exaggerated!",1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I originally thought $20 was some what on the high end for a teething toy.  If you have a teething baby at home you will understand that no amount is to much to soothe your baby.  From the moment I saw this little giraffe I fell in love with how cute it was and is.  My daughter got her 1st two teeth by 3 1/2 months and now at 6 months she already has six teeth.  I am very happy with this product and think it's especially good for young babies since it's easy to hold.  I also love the fact that it squeaks and so does my daughter.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My daughter is 4 months old, and is really starting to chew on things.  I wanted something safe, so I bought her a Sophie.  She loves it!  Once she discovered she could make it squeak, she liked it even more.  The rubber does have kind of a strange smell, but that doesn't seem to bother her.  She likes to chew on the legs the most.  I would definitely recommend this product for other little teethers out there.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I love this toy because when my daughter drools or spits up on Sophie it's easy to clean. Her other toys that are fabric hold all the fluids and have to be washed in the washing machine often. Sophie can be easily wiped or rinsed. It's a little pricey for what it is though.,4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,It is the best teether ever. It does the job and my son loves it. Every baby should have one.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Great teether, soft and hard and noisy in all of the right places....The baby LOVES it!!!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I bought Sophie for all the little teethers in my life this year --there were four-- for holiday gifts.  Well, the feedback has been terrific.  These arrived on time as promised before Christmas and were quite well received by the children as well as their parents.  What a perfect gift!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I used this with my son and loved it. I now like to give it as a gift to expectant/new mothers.,4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I have triplets.  When I first got the product in the mail, I was disappointed.  It looked like a cheap dog toy.  BUT!  My kids love it!  Well worth the money.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I bought this for my teething 6 month old for Christmas because I like giraffes and thought it would be a cute toy.  It is, but I was surprised that the squeaker was SO loud.  It's like one of those annoying squeaking dog toys.  She has had it for a couple of weeks now and doesn't really get excited about playing with it.  She got some B. Squeeze blocks that she loves much more--they are all different colors and have textures on them, plus the squeaking is really subdued.  I would recommend getting those over this toy.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,6 month old grand daughter loves to chew on it.Helps for teething.It is cute and right size for baby. Soft and easy for baby to handle.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This is the 2nd Sophie I have purchased  for my grandkids.  My grandson took his everywhere and i mean everywhere so consider getting the Sophie teether for the bathtub also.  My granddaughter is just loving hers also, and i am so glad that it is something that will calm them down while they are teething, we all know how hard that is.  I have another gradchild to be born in May and I plan to buy Sophie aheadof time for him or her. My granddaughter is teething early so I plan to be prepared for the next one. This is just my preference but I only buy the original Vulli Sophie Giraffe I know it worked for my first grandson so well, why mess with perection. Totally worth the money.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether is a classic toy!  I was skeptical but thought I'd give it a try and I am so glad I did!  My son loved it starting at about 4 months. The only thing is the squeaker does resemble my dog's toys. So on occasion a person may have to rustle it away if the have a dog that loves squeaky toys. Otherwise a great toy!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My daughter told me babies love Sophie so I have been buying these as gifts.  So adorable and charming.  Love her!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I got this for my baby when he was around 5 months old. He loved chewing on it from day one. It was a little smaller than I expected but it was light and very easy for the baby to handle. You have to squeeze the body or head to get it to squeeze. When the baby is chewing on it, you just hear a rubbing rubber noise.The baby is now 8 months old with two teeth and still like to chew on it. Sophie is still looking pretty good but the color has started to fade on the areas where chews on the most (ears and hooves).Your friends will make fun of you for buying such an expensive ""chew toy"" but it is totally worth it :)",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My daughter is 8 months now and still loves her ""Sophie"".  We got this for her when she was three months and, now that the teeth are coming in full force, Sophie offers her some relief. Even as the baby gets more ""play"" oriented Sophie seems to be a top ""go to"" toy--well worth the price.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Sophie is well worth the money! Our 6 month old son LOVES it. It is the only teether that he is able to hold firmly and put any part of it in his mouth. The squeaker is slightly annoying, but tolerable. The surface is a bit tacky and helps him hold onto it better than most toys (and not drop it as esaily in restaurants, etc).",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My 4 month old son is teething, and I've tried all kinds of teethers, but none seem to satisfy him. So, when I read the reviews for Sophie, I figured all these people couldn't be wrong. When I first got her, I was glad that Sophie is not hard, inflexible rubber, which she looks like from the picture. She is much softer, like the rubbery consistency of a dog toy, which some people have already commented on. My thoughts regarding Sophie's likeness to a dog toy is not a far-fetched comparison; this is especially so with the way the squeaker sounds. Our dog LOVES this thing! I have to hide it, but he goes sniffing for it. Anyway, when our son first got his hands on this thing, it went straight into his mouth. And he smiles every time Sophie squeaks, which is so cute to see. He also smiles when he ""gums"" Sophie's body, especially her legs (hooves, actually). So, judging from the way my son puts it in his mouth, and smiles when he does so, I'd say she was a worthwhile purchase, but it is very pricey, nonetheless, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It's handmade, made of natural rubber (from the sap of the Havea tree), hand-painted with food grade colors, and the finished product takes 14 steps to complete. It's been around since 1961 (or 65, I can't remember)and hasn't changed since. But even though she'll be a keepsake, the price is exaggerated. If you want a teether that works, however, Sophie is worth it.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Love that this is made of natural rubber. Perfect for my little one to slobber all over. Ha! I totally recommend. :),5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,A lot of my friends are having children and this is becoming my go-to baby shower present.  Their babies love Sophie!At stores (mostly boutiques) you'll find it for $20+.  Amazon.com has the best price!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Everyone loves this thing.  I think my daughter likes it, but it is far from her favorite toy to chew on.  Maybe it will grow on her....",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My son loves his sophie. It small enough for him to hold and chew and soft enough that he doesn't hurt himself. So...we both LOVE Sophie!!!! And the seller shipped so fast...it was great all around!!!!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My baby wasn't interested in this expensive teether. I was disappointed because, well, Sophie is cute and I like her. I think it depends on the baby if the purchase is worth it. My cousin's baby is a few months younger than my son and she loves it. I gave it to her to enjoy.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My first born loved his Sophie the Giraffe when he was teething. She is very cute and good for a girl or a boy. I have since bought 2 as presents and new one for baby #2. I have not figured out how to clean her without washing away her spots.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My daughter is 6 months and she loves this. Very easy to grab and great for soothing those teeth.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I just noticed this morning when I caught the end of the movie-in the emotional taxi scene towards the end, this is the last thing he gives the baby:)my son loved teething on this and it is great for reaching both the back 2 year old molars and the tough front canines-my son still likes to play with his giraffe!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"baby loves this. i just bought second to keep at grandmas, but it seems different than the first one i bought, is this possible?  amazon sold both teethers to me so i dont get it.  the first one is very soft and flexible but the second one i got today is pretty stiff and is a darker color.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,After spending a small fortune on teethers I decided to try Sophie and glad I did.  My niece loves it.  Only negative thing is you cannot place them in hot water or the dishwasher.  We may invest in other Vulli teethers.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"What a cute giraffe! He's going to be well loved by our new granddaughter! What a fun toy for her, especially during teething times!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My 6 month old LOVES her Sophie giraffe! We have 2...just in case! It instantly calms her down when she's fussy! Great for teething!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My baby girl loves this toy. She's had it ever since she was born and loves it still, 10 months later.She likes to chew on vulli's legs, it soothes her gums when teething.Highly recommended.Stephanie H",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I had heard all the rave reviews about Sophie, but really didn't want to spend $20 on a rubber baby toy. It just seemed ridiculous.  But when teething came on full-force in our house, we were pretty much willing to do anything to give the baby some relief.  He loved Sophie right away and I knew we weren't going to regret getting it for him.  The toy is easy for a baby to hold and chew on, giving lots of relief for painful gums.But...the squeaker. I hate that squeaker. It absolutely does not need to squeak. It doesn't entertain the baby at all. The only thing is does seem to do is drive the dog bonkers. I'd rip that squeaker out if I could.  Having said that, I don't think the squeaker should deter you from purchasing Sophie. It's a great teething toy otherwise.I will say, the baby seems a little less interested in Sophie when he's not actively teething, but that's alright with me. She'll be waiting for him when the next tooth starts to appear.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,,4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"When I purchased this, I didn't realize it had a squeeker inside that makes it sound like a dog chew toy.  I think I still would have purchased it with all of the high ratings, but this caught me off guard.  We purchased this for my 3 month old son who is teething.  He hasn't quite gotten to the stage where everything he grabs goes into his mouth, so he won't play with the giraffe and gnaw on it as we hoped.  If you hold the head (specifically the ears) to his mouth, he will chew on them for just a second before spitting it out.  I'm hoping that he'll grow into this toy, but for now it gets a mediocre review.  I'll update if/when he becomes a fan of this chew toy.**UPDATE:  Well, it has been several weeks now, and he loves his Sophie.  It's tied for top chew toy with the Nuby chew thing that looks like a peanut at the top.  Overall fairly happy, but still wish it didn't squeak.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My baby enjoys bashing Sophie into everything that she sees. She likes the squeaking noise it makes. If we go anywhere, Sophie had better be there too!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I received this in a box set as a gift. It came with a embroidered giraffe wash cloth in a cute little box. As soon as I saw the box I was excited bc I was wondering what was in such a beautiful box with this adorable picture on the front. That is where the excitement ended. I opened the box and saw two of the cheapest baby gifts I could possible encounter. The wash cloth began to unravel as soon as I carefully unhooked it from a board it was attached to. It is very thin and looks as if it will barley survive the washing machine on the gentle cycle. The toy now is kind of junky, the plastic is cheap and feels kind of grain-y when touched even after being washed several times. My baby in not even slightly interested in this toy as soon as she saw it she threw it to the side. Now after reading about this toy being a choking hazard I will be putting it away and let her continue to play with her rattles and such. I think I will keep the box though, it is the best part of the set. It can be used as storage for little toys etc.",2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"As a mother of 16month old twins; I bought Sophie [1 for each, of course] when they were 4 months old after careful reading of all reviews. I heard great things about Sophie and wanted to give her a try. At 4 months babies can't do much more than grasp and semi gnaw on Sophie. For many months I had to squeeze Sophie myself [which I personally enjoyed] and set it on their laps. They LOVED Sophie. The squeak is LOUD and sounds exactly like a dog's squeaky chew toy, just for those who are wondering.As they grew and their motor skills developed to each milestone, Sophie gained more and more individual babytime. The twins were able to squeeze her themselves and chew on her around the clock. They love to throw her, stretch her, squeeze her, chew on her, drool on her... you name it, they have done it. One of the two Sophie's took an extended vacation out in the back yard [unbeknownst to me] and once found, a little water had her looking like a champ again... ready to face another day of playtime.They still enjoy squeezing Sophie [2 at once can do a number on your ears though].Over all: Sophie is durable, soft rubber, easily squeezable, and a very cute toy.With over a year of teething twins, Sophie has not faded, or been worn down. No stretching, or flaking of paint or rubber.Don't be lead astray by bad reviews. This is a GREAT product.The age range I would recommend would be from 6months - 15months. That is where Sophie will get the most use out of your little one.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,this is a super cute toy that my baby really enjoyed but it got dirty and there is a little hole you have to cover to prevent it from breaking and losing its squeak. unfortunately this toy is way overpriced for the quality as mine is just a silent chewie now and that takes the fun out of my baby's learning and play experience. he isnt interested in it anymore. 1 star because it is the lowwest i could go. needs a warning label on how to wash it.,1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I bought Sophie from Amazon before my daughter was even born. It was highly rated and figured it was good. IT IS! My daughters now 6 months and has been playing and biting Sophie since she was 3 months. She loves Sophie. :),5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This was one of my son's favorite toys and now we've been giving them, from him, to everyone we know that is expecting and they've all loved her.  Soft, squeaky, cute and, most importantly, SAFE.  Spreading a little Sophie has been a huge success!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Well worth the price.  This is very durable.  My little guy had 8 teeth by the time he was 7 months and has gnawed on this thing like you wouldn't believe.  It is in the same great condition as when we got it.  The legs of the giraffe allow little ones to localize teething more efficiently.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I can see why mothers swear by this toy, and I knew I just had to try it. My daughter plays with it from time to time, but normally just picks it up and throws it aside. My son wasn't too impressed by it either, he just enjoyed squeaking it in our faces and trying to be as loud as possible with it.I can see where this would come in handy for teething babies since the legs/feet of the giraffe are designed for baby's mouths and have a nice rubber feel to them. It helps at times to give this to my daughter so she doesn't have to chew on my fingers or random toys around the house, but she becomes uninterested in it quickly.I'm upset that I paid so much for it for the lack of use this item gets, but that's the risk one takes. I was a little confused too as to why babies would love this item so much (it reminds me of a rubber dog toy)!I wish I could love this product since it's recommended by so many, but with two uninterested kids and two confused parents by the logic of this item - it just wasn't the best purchase for us.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I bought this for my 9 month old. She has been teething forever and she doesn't like the normal teething toys.  The few times she's been able to get it from her older brothers, she has loved it.  I have to keep reminding my 2 1/2 year old and 4 year old that it is not their toy and to give it to their sister.  So, obviously it's a big hit here!  I like that I don't have to worry about lead paint or BPA and all that.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This is hands down one of the best baby products we have - particularly at this stage (approximately 5 months). My expectations were very high given the positive reviews, and they were easily met. Our little one spends so much time chewing on Sophie's head, then Sophie's ears, then a leg, then she tries to get all four legs in her mouth, etc. The design makes it really easy for little hands to hold on to. Sophie is my go-to toy when we are in public and I need to occupy the baby with something. Yes, it is a little pricey. We received it as a gift and I probably would have balked at spending so much money on a teething toy, but I'm very happy that we have it.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I heard from many people to buy this product. My son is obsessed with it - not sure what makes Sophie so much more fun to chew on than all of his other toys, but I definitely recommend this one!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My son chewed on this giraffe for 3 months straight. It's been washed in the laundry and the dishwasher multiple times. It still looks new. Now that he's a year old, he still likes this toy to play with. I don't know if it's worth $30... but, yes... there's definitely something about Sophie that attracts babies. It's kind of weird.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I would recommend, My four month old loves it!!! She is starting to teeth and it feels good on her gums and keeps her occupied.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I purchased this for my 5 month old daughter and she appears to like it. Very cute. I do have to agree with other users though and say that Sophie reminds me of a dog toy. My dog thought it was for her. I also have to agree that it is a little smelly. I'm hoping the smell will diminish over time. My daughter does not seem to mind the smell at all though and really loves the squeaker. I appreciate that it is made of natural rubber. I probably would not purchase again as I think the price is a little steep, regardless of how 'amazing' she is. I can think of cheaper natural teethers that my daughter would like just as well. Oh, and I did purchase this knowing that legs were a possible choking hazard, which is why I only let her play with it under close supervision.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I heard so many good reviews about this product and decided I had to try it out with my daughter. When I first searched it and saw the price, I was astonished. WOW. That's pretty expensive. But it sure must be worth it with all the people that have bought them. So I gave in and ordered it, not wanting to miss out on this great new teething toy...I must have bought a different version. The toy I received is of no higher quality than a dog toy you would buy at the dollar store. A 3 month old would not know the difference. It's soft rubber so it's easy on her gums and she likes to chew on the ears and bottom of Sophie. Not even 10 minutes after I introduced the toy to my daughter, the coloring started to peel off it's head. That's not really safe if you ask me. I wouldn't want my baby ingesting plastic peeling. I pulled off the part that started peeling though and kept a close eye on it. So far the peeling has stopped. Also, my baby loves the squeaking aspect, but our dogs also pep up every time they hear it. I know that no matter how hard I try to prevent it, sooner or later, Sophie will meet a sad demise as a dog toy.Needless to say, the product did not live up to MY expectations even though my baby likes it just fine. It wasn't worth the money.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I am a grandmother that know a lot about toy and this one looks like a deer I gave my children, which was a great teething toy. I sent one to a cousin which she has greatful for she just heard about it from a friend. Every newborn shoud have this item.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Sophie rocks!  Much softer than it looks and my 5 month old LOVES IT!  Excellent product, best teether toy we have bought!  The squeak keeps him interested too!  Buy it!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Great baby toy! My 6-month-old son loves his Sophie the Giraffe toy! He is currently teething and I read reviews  that Sophie is the best teether out there.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Wow is waht I can say. My grandaughtes 5 mo and  3mo love this toy. Its easy for them to hold and put in there mouths. Would recommend for all teathing babies..,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I thought that Sophie would be a harder rubber, but this is kinda of flimsy and makes me wonder if he could bite through it with teeth.  Also didn't know that it squeaked until I opened the package.  He won't be able to chew on this in quiet areas, aka church etc.  It is really cute and he loves to chew on it so I gave it 4 stars.  Some reviews talk about choking on this toy, I've had no issues with him gagging/choking on it.  My mother in law did make fun of the price I paid for it, but I was willing to pay it for natural rubber and no China lead paint on the toy.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I recently ordered this as a gift and compared the this one to the one my son has and wow u can tell it's fake. The serial number is hard to read and the rubber is way harder than the authentic ones and it's has a funny smells!! So not the original vulli Sophia,2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Grandson loves this Giraffe. It is easy for him to hold onto and he stares at all the spots and the eyes. He also like to try to nibble on the head. It is light weight enough for hime to move it from one hand to the other while investigating it from top to bottom and side to side.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"We purchased this for our 4 month old son and he loves it. He is now 5 months and he uses it every day. The material is soft, easy to grasp and non toxic. I just hope we don't lose it.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My 14 month old daughter loves Sophie.  Is is very light and has lots of differnt things to chew on, from the legs to the head.  It is made of all natural rubber and paint which is great.  Definitely worth the price!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Sturdy material and easy to clean. Light enough for the little one to hold while lying down and not be afraid when he drops it on himself. Would have liked to know beforehand that it squeeks though. But it's fine 'coz the little one likes the sound. He loves chewing on the legs. Will buy this again.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I can't say enough about how much I love this. My 3 month old loves this toy so much. Once she gets her little fingers wrapped around it, she will not let it go. It goes everywhere with us. I'm thinking I need to buy a 2nd one for Nana's house. I'd never heard of Sophie before my 2nd pregnancy, and once I saw it in a magazine, I knew I had to have it. The price seems a little high for a teething toy, but once my daughter saw it and started going crazy for it, I knew it was well worth it.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,This is a great toy for teething babies. We have one for each and they both love it. What more can you say?,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"It looks not good as expected but it useful, it is good for teeth and good quality. I like it.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Despite all theses pretty reviews, I wish I could know why my son didn't like it!! I bought 2 of them. The first when he was 5 months old and I thought I might introduced it early. Later, and because my neighbor girl kept biting it when she came and they refused to take it, my wife cleaned it in the dishwasher :( Then, I had to get him a new one when he was 8 months old. Unfortunately, he didn't like either. So, I quite.",2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My baby is more interested in any other teether, or clothes. I trust on-line reviews, and successfully bought so many interesting toys except this one. It is a waste of money.",2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My baby looooves this teether!  I think she likes the contrasting color, it's light enough for a four month old to handle, the legs fit perfectly in the mouth to soothe the front teeth.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,My 5 month old baby loves it. Easy to hold and keeps her occupied wherever we are! Seems to relieve teething pain quite well..,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My daughter has had this giraffe since she was about 4 months and has loved it since day one.  She is currently 8 months and still loves to suck on it, chew on it, squeak it, or just ""pet"" it.  Great toy, and totally worth the price.",5
