"Just upgraded from 7 to 13. 

So far my impressions are: 
‚Ä¢the screen is genuinely nice to look at, even when locked - blacks are black, whites are white - AMOLED does wonders; ",Positive,0.13333333333333333,0.6083333333333334
"Finally someone appreciating that most people do not upgrade phones every year.

We need more reviews comparing new phones from 2-3 generations back",Positive,0.22727272727272724,0.4909090909090909
"So I‚Äôm upgrading from my dinosaur of a phone, the iPhone 6s. It‚Äôs finally giving out, but has served me well. I‚Äôll be getting the iPhone 13, and I feel like I‚Äôm not going to know what to do with it because it‚Äôs so much more advanced, lol. Looking forward to enjoying better battery life, and the new camera. Thanks for the review, was very helpful!",Positive,0.36515151515151517,0.5393939393939394
I upgraded from my XR to the 13 and I notice a HUGE difference with the camera quality and the battery life.,Positive,0.4000000000000001,0.9
"Marques hit it on the head here. I upgraded from a regular 11 to the 13 mini, and it‚Äôs just a way better phone. Still the basic UI experience you always get from an iPhone, just sharper, clearer, faster, with better battery life, screen, and cameras. T-Mobile was practically giving them away with a tech upgrade, so it was definitely time.",Positive,0.2,0.3403846153846154
"I came from 7 to 13, after almost 3 weeks of using, I feel it‚Äôs a nice upgrade. The camera quality is excellent, the screen is much nicer to look at. I would like to recommend this phone with anyone who is upgrading their phone from 8 to lower version.",Positive,0.6,0.7333333333333334

iPhone 13 Mini is the way to go for me. I love how it looks and the feature set is more than enough for me. What an amazing little device.,Positive,0.28250000000000003,0.6
"I upgraded from an 8 to the 13 mini, and I love the mini. It‚Äôs such a nice upgrade!",Positive,0.4166666666666667,0.7000000000000001
"Started with an iPhone 6, jumped straight to XR and pretty excited for the switch to iPhone 13. Agreed, no need to change every year if cannot afford it.",Positive,0.27499999999999997,0.7166666666666667
"To share my personal experience with the pro max version: I went 48 hrs with the phone without a charger and it survive with 18% of battery left, not full brightness or anything, just regular use and in my opinion it‚Äôs really great for a change",Positive,0.125,0.3353846153846154
This is a nice review! I currently have an iPhone 7 and I just bought the 13 (no review or anything before hand) I saw a lot of people saying I might as well just get the 12 cause it‚Äôs basically the same phone but I was looking at prices and the 12 is only 20 dollars cheaper than the 13 so I spent the extra 20 bucks on the newer model cause it just made sense. I am excited to get an update.,Positive,0.1464285714285714,0.49642857142857144
"I still have an XS and am still super happy with it. I love seeing the new iPhones come out and the new features, but honestly, there hasn‚Äôt been any reason good enough for me to upgrade to a newer iPhone since the X/XS era. Not a bad thing, just interesting!",Positive,0.41810606060606065,0.6342424242424243
"I like hearing that portion in the beginning. It‚Äôs good to think sustainably and I think six years now-days is a good amount to use a device for. Even better if the components inside get recycled! I will never fan-boy for a company l, but I do like some of Apple‚Äôs movements - notably their recycling program, how they‚Äôre using more and more recycled products in their new devices, and their push to using renewable energy. If they could just make them more repairable‚Ä¶ on the flip side, a battery replacement costs far less than a new phone!",Positive,0.38774104683195587,0.5159779614325068
I didn‚Äôt realise how much I‚Äôd like the square sides until I wanted to take a photo and realise it stood on its own,Positive,0.4,0.6
"The larger margin of battery increase in the pro max makes me want it over the others,and i usually tend to go for the 6.1 models as the size is more comfortable (despite me having bigger hands than the average person),but this time I‚Äôm pretty much sold on the large one ‚òùüèª,looks like a phone I‚Äôll easily carry for 3+ years",Positive,0.15976190476190474,0.5411904761904761
"Cinematic mode was the only thing I was interested in on this phone, and Marques did a great job breaking it down.",Positive,0.1788888888888889,0.5477777777777778
I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôve been a long time subscriber. Your reviews usually influence my decision for phones. I actually just ordered the mini today. ‚ò∫Ô∏è,Positive,0.05,0.4375
Great review video as always,Positive,0.8,0.75
"Marques, I respect your passion, commitment, hard work, and dedication. You are an inspiration and an example of professionalism and quality work. The thing is that no matter how much we want to see reviews of the high end phones, not much of us can afford them, so please try to review and cover some of the midrange phones out there like xiaomi, vivo, etc, and by that helping us to make the right decision, when we want to buy a new phone. Currently I have a Pocophone F1, and one of the main reasons I decide to buy that phone was when I saw your video, and you confirmed that the hype about the phone is real and not just good marketing. Keep up the excellent work!",Positive,0.23808982683982682,0.508771645021645
I bet the photo styles idea was inspired by your blind camera tests lol,Positive,0.15000000000000002,0.6833333333333333
My favorite iPhone ever is the 5s. I love the square edges. It has a great feel when holding it.,Positive,0.6,0.7833333333333333
Went from the 7 to the 13. The phone calls are awesome. I used to hate talking on the phone to anyone because I‚Äôm hard of hearing and speaker phone would always distort the sound as well. Now I have no problem talking on the phone with 13 because it sounds like I‚Äôm in the same room as the person‚Ä¶ really clear awesome sound.,Positive,0.22604166666666664,0.59375
"as someone with an iphone eight, that has now been in non-stop use for over 4 years, super excited to get my hands on the 13 and to see the major improvement between them",Positive,0.2569444444444444,0.6388888888888888
I went from a 8+ to a 13 mini and I gotta say it‚Äôs a huge difference especially the battery & camera.,Positive,0.20000000000000004,0.95

I'm upgrading from the 8 and couldn't be more excited! The jump in video quality alone is something I'm looking forward to. I've had mine for about four years :),Positive,0.4895833333333333,0.75
"I upgraded the 6s to the 13, mainly cause it was a backup phone for business. The operating system surprisingly is still very similar to my iphone 6s so still very familiar, obviously, there is a lack of a physical home button, I do wish there was a fingerprint scanner, cannot understand why there is not. Overall good solid phone, fast, good camera and does what it is meant to do.",Positive,0.26856060606060606,0.4132900432900433

"15:47 i think it should be voice over / broll moment. Maybe yes, maybe not. Because the transition seems odd. By the way always superb and nice review bro. Peace from Malaysia",Positive,0.4777777777777778,0.75
"Unbiased as always, that's why you're the best reviewer in the tube universe... Thanks!",Positive,0.625,0.25
"Even when I'm at home for most of the day, I only plug my phone in at night, because at the end of the day, I usually have anywhere from 40-20% left. It's honestly pretty amazing. Also when I have to be on the move for 10 hours, with school and sports, constantly checking my phoine or lisnening to stuff, it really helps to have the amazing battery. Plus, this is all while running pro-motion. Very impressive.",Positive,0.29000000000000004,0.6083333333333334
I went from the 8 to the 13 and definitely more battery life and doesn‚Äôt die as quick and the zoom in and out I love the cerematic mode,Positive,0.4444444444444444,0.5333333333333333
"I‚Äôve just switched from android to the plain 13. Mainly because it was something different. It was also cheaper than the s21. It really is quite a nice experience. I‚Äôve also since seen most people keep iPhones for much longer than they do android. So in truth, it is actually better value and cheaper in the long run",Positive,0.21137566137566136,0.45449735449735457
