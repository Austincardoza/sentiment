"It has always seemed absurd to me selling the keyboard separately. I can‚Äôt imagine anyone using it purely as a tablet. Like I understand selling the pen separately (and keyboard for iPads) as not everyone will be using one and seems more of an optional extra, but keyboard seems like a necessity for surface pro.",Positive,0.053571428571428575,0.525
"I really appreciate Monica's breakdown of everything here. It's the kind of review that I'd share with a relative if they asked about buying the surface pro, and I wouldn't have to worry about explaining anything else. I love it!",Positive,0.35625,0.42500000000000004
Can't wait to upgrade my Pro 5 to this. The form factor update and other improvements are too good to ignore,Positive,0.2875,0.48750000000000004

Well done review. It would be nice to see you do more hardware reviews in the future. Great job covering all the important details for anyone who would consider this device.,Positive,0.4600000000000001,0.675

"I'm blown away. I guess I haven't looked at laptop pricing in so long that I didn't realize they rocketed to outer orbit. I'm only eyeing the Lenovo Duet 5 right now, but just had a flashback to scoring a Broshiba Satellite 15.6 with an i5 in college for $500, and the crucial 10-key. Modern computing is so foreign now.",Positive,0.05178571428571429,0.5601190476190475

"Really nice review!! Personally, I don‚Äôt need such a power and I prefer a traditional 15,6‚Äù laptop. My Lenovo with its 10th gen Core i5 works like a breeze with my usual workflow (Lightroom Classic, 5-6 Edge tabs open and Apple Music the same time) and it cost me about 700‚Ç¨.",Positive,0.10677083333333333,0.4489583333333333
"100% agreed! If it was 300-400 bucks cheaper I would have preordered it already. But oh well, here in Italy SP8 only arrives in January, so I might get a good deal out of it until than. 

It for sure is the Windows tablet I was waiting for, I have to give MS at least that! Those Apple like price tags though are outrageous still.",Negative,-0.03500000000000001,0.7777777777777778

"Hi,
Thank you for the helpful review.
I was wondering whether this device with 32db ram can be useful for a developer (not playing games). I was first thinking of getting the surface laptop pro, but it's too big and I prefer the pro 8.",Positive,0.18333333333333335,0.14444444444444446

Wonderful job with your review. I do like that it has a fan.",Positive,1.0,1.0
"Great review Monica. What was it like having both USB-C ports on the same side of the device? Also, what was palm rejection like while writing with the pen? I noticed in your video that most of the writing was done with your hand off the device.",Positive,0.43333333333333335,0.4583333333333333
The way this video has been put forward is going to help many consumers. I hope to see more videos like this from you. A sub from me. üëç,Positive,0.5,0.5
"Of course cheaper would be nicer, but the price is reasonable considering there's no other device offering the same specs/performance. 
I might consider upgrading from my SP6 once I'm sure Windows 11 is a good user experience. Despite the overheating, my SP3 still works as a sub-office computer. Considering the lack of repairability of these devices, Surface Pro has been a reliable business solution.",Positive,0.2925,0.5177777777777778
"I'm happy with my Surface Pro 7 which I bought a year ago. Got the i5 with 128gb storage that also comes with the keyboard for ¬£750.  In the UK, the Surface Pro 8 starts at ¬£999 with no keyboard. The prices gone up. Yep it has a better screen but it's currently not worth the upgrade for me.",Positive,0.38333333333333336,0.5333333333333333
"I've been using Pro 4, the fan problem just makes us crazy. How can be sure this pro 8 would not get us to the same fan problem?!",Negative,-0.033333333333333326,0.637962962962963
I would assume the refresh rate would and  should scale with power settings examples being on power saving mode it will decrease to 60Hz and on performance mode it will default to 120Hz wether you toggle those modes yourself or not.,Neutral,0.0,0.0
I still prefer the industrial look of Surface Pro 7. Would love a surface keyboard with a bigger trackpad and less prone to grease/oil. Even watching the video we can already see the oily residue on the surfaces of the keyboard and trackpad.,Positive,0.11111111111111112,0.3888888888888889
"""wanted a a redesign""
I had the pro 3 and pro 7. The design is fantastic! Minimal upgrade needed. Less bezel is good but obviously the keyboard decline is optimal and you don't want that covering the screen.",Positive,0.18666666666666668,0.5333333333333334
"Great, balanced review of a great, slightly overpriced product.",Positive,0.4777777777777778,0.5555555555555556
"Well, the Surface Pro line has always been far from wallet-friendly. I remember when I bought my first Surface device back in 2017, it cost nearly as much as this model does considering that the keyboard and the pen has been sold separately and how limited the storage they has provided since then.
And note that the standard warranty only last for 1 year, which is below par with its competitors except Apple.
My biggest concern about this device is its battery life. Despite the improvement made this year, the battery health may deteriorates rapidly like its predecessors do, some of which even swelled severely, causing issues like chassis distortion.",Positive,0.05982142857142858,0.34285714285714286
So excited about this Surface-  Been waiting a long time for these updates!,Positive,0.15625,0.575
"The most frustrating aspect of this tablet is the fact that the volume button is on one side and the power button is on the other side in portrait mode, if you use a stand you can't use it in portrait mode because it interferes with the power button or the volume buttons very difficult for musicians. I think this is a very weak design.",Negative,-0.2325,0.7175

Love that we'll finally be able to use an egpu + video card for more demanding renderings.,Positive,0.5,0.5750000000000001
My biggest concern is the fan. We know that after a while the computer gets dust and starts to heat and fan goes crazy. I would buy this surface pro 8 tomorrow if it has no fan like other surface pro models with no active ventilation at all and using similar i5 intel ships.,Negative,-0.16458333333333333,0.56875

"Great review, so thanks for posting. Currently, I'm running an iPad Pro 12.9, 2TB, Magic Keyboard, and Pen2. Clocks out at $3k-ish' with AppleCare. Please know this is not bragging as I'm not all that impressed with it. I've been using Apple products since 1983, and over time, my allegiance to the platform is running thin. With the release of Windows 11 and the refinement of the Microsoft Surface line, I'm planning to switch camps. My last two Apple MacBook/Pros broke twice, and they didn't last as long as the older Apple MacBook series. In my view, Apple is now no better than some WinTel machines. Finally, while I am judicious when subscribing to channels, I liked your speaking style so well that I subscribed right away. Regards, SV-PR",Positive,0.20374149659863947,0.5644557823129251
"I just watched a review where they compared the i5 vs i7, both with 16GB of memory and there was very little ‚Äòpractical‚Äô difference between the two.",Negative,-0.24375000000000002,0.65
"Nice review, but I would have mentioned the fact that the pro 8 is quite a bit heavier than its predecessors, at 2 pounds (almost 900gr). Personally that‚Äôs beyond what I consider usable as a tablet (the surface pro 7 and pro X, at 100gr less were already at the limit of that)",Positive,0.14444444444444446,0.45555555555555555
"That price tag is steep, especially for a mid-spec model, even if you skimp on an SSD and upgrade it later it is still quite a chunk of cash, but it might be worth the premium for that beautiful super light form factor. I will wait for a price drop or perhaps an future AMD version which may offer better battery life and better pricing in lieu of Thunderbolt, if it ever sees the light of day that is. But it is safe to say it is indeed the Surface Pro most of us were hoping for!",Positive,0.3673611111111111,0.5243055555555556
"Wonder if they finally fixed the issue with the hinge. Mine starting have problems last year and I ended up buying a tablet cover (or three) with built in hinges due to Microsoft not having a ""fix it"" policy. I'd have paid to have it fixed but there is nothing to support that. You could trade in your Surface Pro but that's about it. 

 Basically my Surface Pro would start to slide out of the tablet, the flexible plastic material would come out a bit and wouldn't go back in or work correctly. I ended doing a bunch of Googling on how to fix it and finally found YouTube videos on how to do that. Once you do figure out how to fix it yourself, it's still doesn't feel too secure so again a tablet cover becomes a must with a hinge to prop your Pro with. :/",Positive,0.025000000000000005,0.3935185185185185
